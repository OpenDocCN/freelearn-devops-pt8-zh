    and define) and encompassing structure (modules), you are in a great position
    to write manifests for all of your agents. Make sure that you get Forge modules
    that will allow them to do your work for you. Then go ahead and add site-specific
    modules that implement Forge modules to your needs. Finally, you will have composite
    classes for the `node` blocks to be used, or rather, included.

- en: Templates are an alternative way to manage configuration files, or any files
    really. You have synchronized files from the master to an agent that handled some
    Apache configuration settings. These are not templates, technically. They are
    merely static files that have been prepared and are ready for carbon copying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These static files suffice in many situations, but sometimes, you will want
    the master to manage very specific configuration values for each agent. These
    values can be quite individual. For example, an Apache server usually requires
    a `MaxClients` setting. Appropriate values depend on many aspects, including hardware
    specifications and characteristics of the web application that is being run. It
    would be impractical to prepare all possible choices as distinct files in the
    module.

    any template it encounters. The EPP evaluation happens in an individual environment
    that is derived from the respective scope of the `epp` function invocation.
  prefs: []

    manifest requires frequent expansion of a very short template, it generates an
    enormous overhead for each initialization. Especially in the case of an easy `inline_epp`
    function, such as the one mentioned previously, it can be worthwhile to invest
    some more effort into creating a parser function instead, as seen in [Chapter
    5](3217a4c2-135e-46b4-bcf2-eef9ddce9991.xhtml), *Combining Classes, Configuration

    Imagine that you find yourself in a situation where a large number of different

    It allows you to add a resource declaration to your manifest without adding the

    can happen arbitrarily in the same manifest.

    a class can contain many resources and even more `include` statements.
