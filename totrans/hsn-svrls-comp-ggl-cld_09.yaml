- en: In this section, you will learn about Cloud Run, Google's latest product for
    the management of serverless workloads. Cloud Run deploys with or without the
    Kubernetes platform, so the initial discussion focuses on the basics of a non-Kubernetes
    environment. Here, we learn about containers and some of the supporting developer
    tools on Google Cloud (for example, Cloud Build and Container Registry). Following
    on from this, we take a look at how to use Cloud Run for Anthos in conjunction
    with Kubernetes. Finally, in this series of chapters, we cover the topic of CI/CD.
