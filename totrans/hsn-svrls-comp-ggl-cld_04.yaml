    make it such a compelling product for building lightweight functions. The initial
    discussion outlines the central properties of working with functions on Google
    Cloud. The remaining chapters provide an overview of the product capabilities
    and integration with services such as Stackdriver and Cloud Build. Finally, we
    build on the examples presented to create a small application to augment the concepts
    covered across the four chapters on Google Cloud Functions.
