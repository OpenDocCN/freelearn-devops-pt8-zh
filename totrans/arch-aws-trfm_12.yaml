    for several reasons. First, governance and auditability can help ensure that your
    infrastructure is compliant with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
    This is critical for organizations that operate in regulated industries, where
    failure to comply with regulations can result in significant financial and reputational
    damage. By building governance and auditability into your infrastructure provisioning
    process, you can ensure that your infrastructure meets all the necessary regulatory
    requirements and is properly managed and audited.

    By enforcing **role-based access control** (**RBAC**) and code reviews, and implementing
    compliance checks and configuration drift detection, you can reduce the risk of
    unauthorized changes and potential security incidents. This can help protect your
    organization’s sensitive data and resources and reduce the risk of data breaches
    and other security incidents.
