<p>OpenStack is open source software for building public and private clouds as well as privately hosted software defined infrastructure services. In the fall of 2017, the OpenStack Foundation released the 16th version of OpenStack, known as Pike, to the public. Since its introduction as an open source project in 2010 by NASA and Rackspace, OpenStack has undergone significant improvements in its features and functionality thanks to developers and operators worldwide. Their hard work has resulted in production-ready cloud software that powers workloads of all sizes throughout the world.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Folsom release of OpenStack introduced a standalone networking component known then as Quantum. Long since renamed Neutron, the networking component of OpenStack provides cloud operators and users with an API used to create and manage network resources in the cloud. Neutron's extensible framework allows for third-party plugins and additional network services, such as load balancers, firewalls, and virtual private networks, to be deployed and managed.</p>
<p>As an architect and operator of hundreds of OpenStack-based private clouds since 2012, I have seen much of what OpenStack has to offer in terms of networking capabilities. In this book, I have condensed what I feel are its most valuable and production-ready features to date. Throughout this book, we will take a look at a few common network and service architectures and lay a foundation for deploying and managing OpenStack Networking that can help you develop and sharpen your skills as an OpenStack cloud operator.</p>

<p>This book is geared towards OpenStack cloud administrators or operators with a novice to intermediate level of experience in managing OpenStack-based clouds who are looking to build or enhance their cloud using the networking service known as Neutron. By laying down a basic installation of OpenStack based on the upstream documentation found at <a href="http://docs.openstack.org">docs.openstack.org</a>, the reader should be able to follow the examples laid out in the book to obtain a functional understanding of the various components of OpenStack Networking using open source reference architectures.</p>

<p>This book assumes a moderate level of networking experience, including experience with Linux networking configurations as well as physical switch and router configurations. While this book walks the reader through a basic installation of OpenStack, little time is spent on services other than Neutron. Therefore, it is important that the reader has a basic understanding of OpenStack and its general configuration prior to configuring OpenStack networking.</p>
<p>In this book, the following operating system is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</li>
</ul>
<p>The following software is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenStack Pike (2017.2)</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Internet connectivity is required to install OpenStack packages and to make useÂ </span>of the example architectures in the book. While virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware can be used to simulate servers and the network infrastructure, this book assumes that OpenStack is installed on physical hardware and that a physical network infrastructure is in place.</p>
<p>In the event that the OpenStack installation procedure documented in this book is no longer current, refer to the installation guide at <a href="http://docs.openstack.org">docs.openstack.org</a> for instructions on installing the latest version of OpenStack.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <kbd>OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DEFAULT_ROLE</kbd> setting in the<kbd>/etc/openstack- dashboard/local_settings.py</kbd> file must also be modified before the dashboard can be used."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>[DEFAULT]<br/>...<br/>my_ip = 10.254.254.101<br/>vncserver_proxyclient_address = 10.254.254.101<br/>vnc_enabled = True<br/>vncserver_listen = 0.0.0.0<br/>novncproxy_base_url = http://controller01:6080/vnc_auto.html</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>nova boot --flavor &lt;FLAVOR_ID&gt; --image &lt;IMAGE_ID&gt; \</strong><br/><strong> --nic net-id=&lt;NETWORK_ID&gt;--security-group &lt;SECURITY_GROUP_ID&gt; \ INSTANCE_NAME</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="CommandLinePACKT"><span># systemctl restart nova-api<br/></span><strong><span># systemctl restart neutron-server</span></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
