<p>In the previous chapter, we created an Azure storage account using PowerShell and from the Azure Storage Explorer, we created a blob container for that storage account and uploaded some files to it as well.</p>
<p>In this section, we are going to configure Azure Blob Storage from PowerShell. We are going to use the same storage account that we created in the previous chapter, but now we will use PowerShell to add a blob container to it. We will also provide an example to create multiple blob containers at once. Therefore, take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to log in to the Azure account as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Connect-AzAccount</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If necessary, select the right subscription <span>as follows</span>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "********-****-****-****-***********"</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select the storage account that we created in the previous chapter and <span>add it to a variable as follows</span>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$accountObject = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "PacktPubStorageAccount" -AccountName "packtpubstorage"<br/></strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Then retrieve the context of the storage account:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$Context = $accountObject.Context</strong></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Create a blob container to it with public access as <kbd>Blob</kbd> <span>as follows:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>new-AzStoragecontainer -Name "packtblobcontainerps" -Context $Context -Permission blob</strong></pre>
<p>We are going to use this blob container in the next section, where we will create an import into and an export using Azure Job.</p>

<p>You can create an import and export job for your Azure Blob Storage (and Azure file storage) account to upload data from on-premises data disks to Azure. This service can be used to import large amounts of data into your Azure Blob Storage. It does require you to ship encrypted disk drives with the data on it to an Azure Datacenter.</p>
<p>The disk drives that are going to be <span>shipped </span>to the Azure Datacenter need to be prepared before shipment. BitLocker encryption needs to be enabled and, once the volume is encrypted, you can copy the data to it. After encryption, the disk needs to be prepared using the <kbd>WAImportExport.exe</kbd> <span>tool. By running this tool, there is automatically a</span> <em>journal file</em> <span>created in the same folder that you ran the tool. There are two other files created as well, an </span><kbd>.xml</kbd><span> file and a </span><kbd>drive-manifest.xml</kbd><span> file. You need these files later for creating the import/export job. The disk is now ready to be shipped to Azure.</span></p>
<p>After the disks are shipped to Azure, you can create an import or export job from the Azure portal. Therefore, you have to take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the Azure portal by opening <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com/</a>.</li>
<li>From the left menu, click <span class="packt_screen">All services</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Storage</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Import/export jobs</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li class="mce-root"><span>As</span> shown <span>in the</span> following screenshot, click <span class="packt_screen">Create import/export job</span><span>:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/04e44100-2b1f-4f5b-ad44-5268e4e6ebfd.png"/></div>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Creating an import/export job</span><strong><br/></strong></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the next blade, you can choose between creating an import or an export job. Select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Import into Azure</span></strong>, give the job a name, and select a resource group or create a new resource group as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/93168ab6-dddc-4649-b1d0-4ccd65c9e6ca.png" style="width:36.25em;height:26.92em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Defining the job type</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click <strong><span class="packt_screen">OK</span></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In the next blade, you need to upload the journal files that are created when you prepared the disks. Select the journal files from your local computer and select the import destination as follows:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/698d3e5a-b187-4fad-8c32-b4c79a942d33.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Upload journal <span>files</span></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Click <strong><span class="packt_screen">OK</span></strong>.</li>
<li>In the last two steps, you can provide the return shipping information for your disks and configure them. The data can now be uploaded to the storage account that you have selected in the previous step.</li>
<li><span>The steps for creating an export job are </span>similar<span><span> to those for creating the import job. Just select export job in the first step and fill in the required fields. You don't have to upload the journal files, just select the storage account from where you want to export the data as follows:</span></span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f815baa2-62bb-4aec-be80-c1030a5b6189.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Export job settings<br/>
<br/></span></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Then provide the shipping details again, and Microsoft will copy the data to the drive and ship it back to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>This concludes the import and export Azure Job objective. In the next section, we are going to look at Azure CDN and how to configure it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure CDN</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A CDN is a service that can be used to scale your apps globally. It caches your static content, such as HTML pages, style sheets, images, documents, files, and client-side scripts on edge servers in different regions. This way, it will take less time to download them because the content is <span>physically closer to the user, which increases the performance of your apps.</span></p>
<p>Azure CDN offers the following pricing tiers: Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft<span>, </span>Azure CDN Standard from Akamai<span>, </span>Azure CDN Standard from Verizon<span>, and </span>Azure CDN Premium from Verizon<span>.</span></p>
<p>Azure CDN offers the following key features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic site acceleration</strong>: Normally, CDNs have the ability to cache files closer to the end users to speed up the performance of loading the files. However, with dynamic web applications, the content is generated in response to the user behavior. Speeding up the loading process is more complex in these situations and requires a different solution, where each content element is fine-tuned along the full data path from inception to delivery. <span>This feature is part of </span><em>Azure CDN from Akamai</em> and <em>Azure CDN from Verizon</em>. </li>
<li><strong>CDN caching rules</strong>:<span> </span>By<strong> </strong><span>using</span> caching rules, the default cache <span>expiration can be set or</span><span> </span><span>modified globally, and by using custom conditions, such as URL path and file extension. Azure CDN provides the following two different ways of controlling how files are cached:</span>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Caching rules</strong>: The following global and custom caching rules are available:</span>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Global caching rules</strong>: For each endpoint in your CDN profile, you can set one global caching rule. This will affect all requests that are made to that endpoint. If set, this global rule will override any HTTP cache-directive headers.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Custom caching rules</strong>: You can set one or more custom caching rules for each endpoint in your CDN profile. </span>These rules match specific file extensions and paths, are processed in order, and override the global caching rule, if set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span><strong>Query string caching</strong>: How Azure CDN treats caching for requests with query strings can be adjusted as well. The query string caching setting has no effect if the file itself is not cacheable based on caching rules and CDN default behaviors. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS custom domain support</strong>: If you are using the HTTPS protocol on your custom domain (for instance,<span> </span><kbd>https:az-103.com</kbd>) for your apps (by installing an SSL certificate), a secure connection is made over TLS/SSL. Azure CDN supports HTTPS on a CDN endpoint host name by default. So, if you create a CDN endpoint (for instance,<span> </span><kbd>https://https:az-103.azureedge.net</kbd>), HTTPS is enabled automatically.<span> </span><span>This feature is not available with </span>Azure CDN Standard from Akamai products.</li>
<li><strong>Azure diagnostics logs</strong>: You can view core analytics and save them to a variety of different sources.<span> </span><span>Azure diagnostics logs give you the ability to export the basic usage metrics from the CDN endpoints to an Azure storage account and then to a CSV, where you can create graphs in Excel to Azure Event Hubs and correlate data from other Azure services to Log Analytics workspace, and view data in there as well. This feature is available for all the pricing tiers.</span></li>
<li><strong>File compression</strong>: File compression is an effective way to speed up the transferring of files and increasing the performance of the page load of your app. The file size is reduced before it is sent from the server. This can provide a more responsive experience for your app and can reduce the bandwidth costs. There are the following two options of file compression available:
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable compression on the origin server</strong>: Azure CDN passes on the files that are already compressed at the server and delivers them to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Enable compression on the CDN POP servers (compression on the fly)</strong>:<em> </em>The CDN compresses the files itself and delivers them to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Geo-filtering</strong>:<strong> </strong>With Azure CDN, you can restrict access to content by country. You can create rules on specific paths on your CDN endpoint to block or allow content in selected countries. This feature is not supported by Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">For comparing the features and capabilities of the different CDN products that are available for Azure, you can refer to the following article: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-features">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-features</a>.</div>
<p>In the next section, we are going to configure Azure CDN endpoints.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Data that is moved to Azure over the network isn't always as fast as required for organizations. With the Azure Data Box solution, you can send t<span>erabytes of data into Azure quickly. You can order this Data Box solution from the Azure portal. You will then receive a Data Box storage device with a storage capacity, which can be used to transfer the data securely.</span></p>
<p>Azure offers the following three different types of storage device:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Box</strong>: This device, with 100 TB of capacity, uses standard <strong>network attached storage</strong> (<strong>NAS</strong>) protocols and common copy tools. It features AES 256-bit encryption for safer transit.</li>
<li><strong>Data Box Disk</strong>: This device had a capacity of 8 TB with SSD storage (with packs of up to 5 for a total of 40 TB). It has a <span>USB/SATA interface and has 128-bit encryption. </span></li>
<li><strong>Data Box Heavy (Preview)</strong>: This is a <span>self-contained device that is designed to lift 1 PB of data to the cloud.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can copy this data from your servers to one of the devices and ship this back to Azure. Microsoft will then upload this data in the Azure Datacenter from the device. This entire process is tracked by the Data Box service in the Azure portal to deliver insights in all the steps of this data migration process.</p>
<p><span>This Data Box solution is well suited for scenarios where there is no or limited network connectivity and where data sizes larger than 40 TB need to be migrated. It is also an ideal solution for one-time migrations, and for initial bulk transfers, </span><span>followed by incremental transfers over the network.</span></p>
<p>For the incremental transfers over the network, Azure offers the following two different services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Data Box Gateway:</strong> Data Box Gateway is a virtual device based on a virtual machine provisioned in your virtualized environment or hypervisor. The virtual device resides in your on-premises environment and you write data to it using the <strong>Network File System</strong> (<strong>NFS</strong>) and <strong>Server Message Block</strong> (<strong>SMB</strong>) protocols. The device then transfers your data to Azure block blobs, page blobs, or Azure Files.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Data Box Edge:</strong> Azure Data box Edge is a <span>physical device supplied by Microsoft for secure data transfer. This device resides in your on-premises environment, and you can write data to it using the NFS and SMB protocols. Data Box Edge has all the gateway capabilities of Data Box Gateway. Data Box is additionally equipped with AI-enabled edge computing capabilities that help analyze, process, or filter data as it moves to Azure block blobs, page blobs, or Azure Files.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram gives you an overview of the steps that are taken to store the data onto the device and ship it back to Azure:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Azure Data Box</div>
<p>We have now looked at Azure Data Box and the different methods that you can use to ship your data to Azure. This concludes this chapter.</p>
