<p>Azure AD Connect Health offers you the ability to monitor and gain insights into the identity infrastructure used to extend on-premises identities to Azure Active Directory and Office 365. You can view alerts, performance information, usage patterns, and configuration settings; it enables you to maintain a reliable connection to Office 365 and much more. This is accomplished by using an agent that's installed on the targeted servers.</p>
<p>The diagram that follows shows how Azure AD Connect Health communicates. It also shows the components that are currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong> (<strong>ADDS</strong>) 2008R2 up to 2016</li>
<li>Azure AD Connect Version 1.0.9125 or higher</li>
<li><strong>Active Directory Federation Services</strong> (<strong>ADFS</strong>) and <strong>Windows Azure Pack</strong> (<strong>WAP</strong>) 2008R2 up to 2016</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_quote packt_infobox">You can find the actual support and licensing requirements at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-health-faq">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-health-faq</a>.</div>
<p class="mce-root">The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/209c79e5-f78e-4b56-8264-58e2760a7679.png" width="893" height="480"/></p>
<div class="packt_tip">To deploy all Azure AD Connect Health Agents, you'll need to finish the lab tasks in <a href="468509fa-856c-411d-abdb-e9a39c266750.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Developing Solutions on Azure AD and ADFS</em>, because in this lab, you'll install ADFS and the Web Application Proxy.</div>
<p>The installation is a very easy task and <span>always</span> follows the same routine. In the following screenshot, under <span class="packt_screen">Get tools</span>, you'll find all of the actual binaries for the agents.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The health agent for Azure AD Connect will always be installed with the tool itself. Azure AD Connect Health requires Azure AD Premium P1 licenses.</div>
<p>The following steps can be used to install and configure the feature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install the binaries on the specific server.</li>
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">Configure</span>.</li>
<li>Provide global administrator credentials to successfully register the agent with the service.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following screenshot shows the starting page, where you can download the agents:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8ced9c30-af7c-43dd-ae94-3ef7c30190c5.png" style="width:49.58em;height:33.75em;" width="831" height="565"/></p>
<p>With the Azure AD Connect Health Agent, you'll get all of the insights about your synchronization process, as we discussed in <a href="c0918163-6616-4bdb-aa82-4a65f578d268.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Understanding Identity Synchronization</em>. You'll find the current configuration information and alerts from the synchronization engine, including synchronization errors. Furthermore, if your Azure AD Connect manages thousands of users, groups, and other objects, you'll get the related information about the <span class="packt_screen">Run Profile latency</span>. The service helps you to gather the actual performance and values for future planning, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ece03cdb-0d3e-4504-b573-f1866cac3675.png" style="width:64.25em;height:40.83em;" width="1148" height="730"/></p>
<p>The ADFS Health Agent is used by ADFS and the Web Application Proxy role. The agent needs to be installed on any server with these specific roles. The agent delivers the following fundamental values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security reports for the top 50 users who have bad username/password attempts</li>
<li>High-failure IP report for ADFS sign-ins</li>
<li>Monitoring with alerts email notifications</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Usage analytics for ADFS sign-ins with pivots (apps, network location, and other information)</li>
<li class="fxs-part-titleText msportalfx-tooltip-overflow"><span class="packt_screen">Token Requests/sec</span> <span class="packt_screen">from the last 24 hours</span></li>
<li>Trends in performance data for capacity planning</li>
<li>Certificate information</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see metric values under the chart's configuration in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img style="font-size: 1em;width:51.42em;height:33.17em;" src="Images/7b3c3265-1473-4e97-8808-cede864296de.png" width="887" height="574"/></p>
<p>You'll find the actual capabilities at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs</a>.</p>
<p>The Agent Installation Wizard guides you through a very fast setup experience, and you just need to provide global administrator credentials to register the agent.</p>
<p>If IE enhanced security is enabled, the following websites must be allowed on the server that's going to have the agent installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com"><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com"><span>https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://login.windows.net"><span>https://login.windows.net</span></a></li>
<li><span>The IE local intranet zone needs to include your ADFS server, such as <a href="https://login.inovitdemos.ch">https://login.inovitdemos.ch</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows the installation dialog of the agent:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7bb4bbc8-8005-4d14-ab95-8f5c46869b79.png" style="width:27.42em;height:17.00em;" width="478" height="296"/></p>
<p>To use the ADFS Health agent, you need to configure the auditing settings on the server with the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable</strong><br/><strong>Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel Verbose</strong></pre>
<p>The ADFS service account needs to able to <span class="packt_screen">Generate security audits</span>, for example, in the local security policy configuration under <span class="packt_screen">Security Settings</span>|<span class="packt_screen">Local Policies</span>|<span class="packt_screen">User Rights Assignment</span>.</p>
<p>After installing the ADFS Health Agent, you should find the following three new services:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Diagnostic Service</span></li>
<li><span><span class="packt_screen">Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Insight Service</span></span></li>
<li><span><span class="packt_screen">Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Monitoring Service</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll<span> also</span> get a lot of information about the ADFS and Web Application Proxy infrastructure. After completing your configuration in the test environment, we expect a result similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3c18f38a-b7f1-45c2-91ad-18d36abeaab5.png" style="width:61.75em;height:55.00em;" width="1139" height="1015"/></p>
<p>At the time of writing, two new features are the <span class="packt_screen">Bad password attempt</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Risky IP</span> features, which help you to protect against attacks to your authentication infrastructure. In <a href="468509fa-856c-411d-abdb-e9a39c266750.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Deploying Solutions on Azure AD and ADFS</em>, we'll discuss more security features that will be provided through ADFS on the Windows Server 2019 and the upcoming features in the field of identity protection:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0c9020ef-bd4f-4af3-9108-deb8e4390c97.png" style="width:24.08em;height:6.67em;" width="347" height="95"/></p>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox"><span>You'll find</span> more information about the feature sets of Azure AD password protection and risky sign-in reports at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-troubleshoot">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-troubleshoot</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risky-sign-ins">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risky-sign-ins</a>.</div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Azure AD Connect Health agent</span> for the Active Directory helps you to identify problems with your directory services infrastructure. You can gather information such as the count of domain controllers, the domains and sites, and the current holders of the <strong>Flexible Single Master Operation</strong> (<strong>FSMO</strong>) roles. A very helpful feature provides the monitoring sections, which allow you to get insights about the LDAP binds and the Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Furthermore, replication information is also provided through this agent. The agent installation follows the same procedures as for ADFS, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/18467b1d-2190-4159-862b-3ccdb17f9b9b.png" style="width:36.25em;height:25.33em;" width="593" height="414"/></p>
<p>After the installation, you should find two more services, as shown at the top of the following screenshot. The last two services listed in the screenshot show the <span class="packt_screen">Azure AD Connect Health</span> <span class="packt_screen">Synchronizatio</span><span class="packt_screen">n</span> services:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e8e8e5fb-8cd0-4f27-aa1a-095404280a06.png" style="width:21.67em;height:9.25em;" width="315" height="135"/></p>
<p>The following screenshot shows you insights about the Active Directory health state, including authentication performance data:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4f246017-6e40-4f87-9c9b-3f0a5cef0bb2.png" style="width:66.42em;height:53.08em;" width="1299" height="1039"/></p>
<p>To conclude, let's look at some additional practical tips we always need in our projects. The following steps can be useful to configure your environment for several needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proxy servers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>You can import the IE settings with the following cmdlet:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromInternetSettings</strong></pre>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>Or you can import the proxy settings from your WinHTTP configuration:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromWinHttp</strong></pre>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>Or you can set the proxy completely manually:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress address:port</strong></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing the health agent connectivity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Testing can be done with the following cmdlet:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role ADFS</strong></pre>
<p>The output for a working configuration looks as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e8a4503e-5184-40e4-a650-c07b26d715c8.png" style="width:52.17em;height:24.08em;" width="778" height="360"/></p>
<p>Now that we've worked through the Azure AD Connect Health Service, we'll continue our journey with the Azure AD monitoring and logs features.</p>

<p>In this section, we'll explore the Azure Security Center's capabilities for monitoring our identity and access-management infrastructure. With the Azure Security Center, you're able to understand the security state across your on-premises environments and cloud workloads. New Azure resources will be automatically discovered and on-boarded and you can apply security policies across your complete hybrid environment to ensure compliance with actual security standards. The service also provides the collection, search, and analysis of several sources, including third-party solutions and firewalls. Furthermore, we can find threats with advanced analysis mechanisms and are able to respond and recover from incidents because of the provided real-time security alerts. The export of your security events into an SIEM solution for further analysis is possible. The service integrates many new threat-detection parts, such as behavioral profiling, machine learning, and global intelligence <span>threats</span>.</p>
<p>The Azure Security Center can find many different attacks, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compromised machines</li>
<li>Failed exploitation attempts</li>
<li>Advanced malware</li>
<li>Web application vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Brute-force attacks</li>
<li>Data exfiltration</li>
</ul>
<div class="mce-root packt_tip">The monitoring identity and access feature set is in preview. You need to use a standard-tier plan of the Azure Security Center to use this functionality. Actually, there is a limit of 600 accounts for using the identity recommendations.</div>
<p>With the monitoring of identity activities, you can provide a higher level of security for your organization, because you can provide proactive actions before an incident happens. Furthermore, you are in the position to stop an active attack. The identity and access dashboard provides you with insights and recommendations for your subscription, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable MFA for privileged accounts</li>
<li>Remove external accounts with write permissions</li>
<li>Remove privileged external accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll find the following message if we start on the portal: <span class="packt_screen">You have subscriptions that are not fully protected. Upgrade to the Standard tier for more recommendations</span>:</p>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>With the following steps, we will enable the feature set:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade to an Azure Security Center standard instance:</li>
</ol>

<p>We also see that we're directly able to dive deeper into the monitoring and log information through the log-analytics integration, which can be used on the top of the portal. We highly recommend that you come back to the monitoring portals during the work on all labs provided in this book to see the several components in action.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed the key monitoring and log capabilities to hold your identity infrastructure in a stable and suitable state. We learned which functionality is provided by the Azure AD section in the Azure portal. Furthermore, we saw how Azure AD Connect Health works and how easy it is to install and configure your environment. We extended our solution and now have a broader view of the whole security state of the hybrid environment through the Azure Security Center. You should be able to answer questions about the identity infrastructure-monitoring capabilities and to configure a suitable monitoring and log solution for your own organization or customers. </p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to use the Azure Identity Protection features to protect your cloud and on-premises environment. We will discuss and configure the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management capabilities.</p>
