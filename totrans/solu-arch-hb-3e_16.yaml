    capabilities of the various suppliers, where the buyer can compare all suppliers
    in similar parameters and proceed to the next proposal steps with shortlisted
    suppliers. For example, let’s say a company is exploring the market to identify
    **learning management systems** (**LMSs**) that meet its training needs. The company

    each approach. For example, say a government agency wants to upgrade its IT infrastructure.
