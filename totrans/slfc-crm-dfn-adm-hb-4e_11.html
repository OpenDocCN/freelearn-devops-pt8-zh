The Certified Administrator program covers the applications that form the core elements of Salesforce CRM and includes system management and the configuration options that are available to a Salesforce CRM administrator within the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, and the Collaboration Cloud.</p><p>The Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is used to measure individual's ability to manage and maintain a Salesforce CRM organization. Individuals that pass the exam can be considered proficient in applying the features and functionality for configuration and system management as well as extending their knowledge and accessing advanced learning paths within the Certified Administrator program.</p><p>In this chapter, we outline the various resources that are available to study for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam. Here we review the Salesforce Certified Administrator Study Guide and discuss both, official Salesforce and other third-party resources that will help you understand the features and functionalities that are to be found in the exam. We also look at the process of planning, booking, and sitting the exam, and offer some insight into the types of questions that may appear and offer some suggestions to deal with the questions during the exam.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Overview of the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Self-assessment of your Salesforce CRM skills and knowledge</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Suggested resources for studying</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Salesforce Certified Administrator study guide</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Registering for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What to expect during and after the exam</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Overview of the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec118"/>Overview of the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam</h1></div></div></div><p>The Salesforce Certified Administrator exam consists of 60 multiple-choice (or single-choice) questions and the maximum time allowed is 90 minutes. There is no mandatory prerequisite qualification or experience; however, Salesforce highly recommends that candidates have some real-world experience administering an organization or attend a suitable training course prior to sitting the exam, details of which are covered later in this chapter.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note353"/>Note</h3><p>The pass mark for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is currently 39 correct answers out of the available 60, which is specified as a percentage passing score of 65%. At the time of writing, the cost of registering for the exam is $200 USD and the cost of registering to re-sit the exam is $100 USD.</p></div></div><p>During the exam, no written or online resource may be referenced and when you submit the exam you are presented with your exam result immediately. The result is either a pass or fail; there is neither an indication of the number of correct or incorrect answers, nor is there any response that explains the reason for the correct or incorrect answers.</p><p>Some people have opined on social networking sites that the questions they were presented with during their Salesforce Certified Administrator exam made for a far more difficult examination than anything they had previously sat and for one individual they felt it was more difficult than their bachelor's degree or their MBA.</p><p>People often cite the reason for the difficulty of the exam is that the way in which the multiple-choice questions are worded means that there are one or two word differences between the available choice of answer. This then suggests that the question may be subjective, which presents a challenge when choosing the expected answer.</p><p>Later in this chapter, there is an indication of how these potentially subjective questions could be presented and some suggested strategies that may help to derive the correct answer.</p><p>Once you have passed the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, there is a maintenance exam which is a requirement to remain in, Salesforce Certified Administrator program. This is mandatory for all Salesforce Certified individuals to keep their knowledge current as Salesforce releases updates to the Salesforce CRM platform.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note354"/>Note</h3><p>At the time of writing, the cost of registering for the annual maintenance fee for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is $100 USD.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Self-assessment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec262"/>Self-assessment</h2></div></div></div><p>Before considering taking the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, it is useful to try to gauge just how much knowledge and experience you have in Salesforce CRM administration. Since the exam is part of the Salesforce Certified Administrator program, which exists to assess an individual's ability to implement Salesforce CRM administration, the purpose of the exam is to assess the skills and ensure candidates have the correct level of knowledge in the following features or functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Standard and Custom Objects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Security and Access</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Analytics, Reports, and Dashboards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Data Management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User Setup</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sales and Marketing Applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Workflow Automation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Service and Support Applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Activity Management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AppExchange</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Desktop and Mobile Administration</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Content and Folder Management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Chatter</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Global User Interface</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Organization Setup</li></ul></div><p>The features and functions that are listed are taken from the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam Study Guide and will be covered in detail later in this chapter. You should review the features and functions that are listed here and try to give higher or lesser importance accordingly. This means that the number of questions that may be posed will vary in line with the percentages. You should review the features and functions that are listed in this section to help assess what areas your strengths and weaknesses lie in and allow you to plan your studying accordingly.</p><p>By going through the list, you can assess how much of the subject area you currently know and which areas you may need to study more. Even seasoned Salesforce professionals may not have experience in all of the areas that are likely to be covered in the exam, so there will generally be some need to study the areas of weakness.</p><p>For example, there could be as high as 11 questions, (or 18% exam coverage), in the exam covering standard and custom objects or as few as one question, (or 2% exam coverage) for <span class="strong"><strong>Chatter</strong></span>. Given these numbers, it does seem prudent to focus more of your time available for study on the features and functions of the chapters that carry the largest number of questions.</p></div><div class="section" title="Resources for studying"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec263"/>Resources for studying</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many resources available to help the process of studying for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam. The resources that will be outlined in this section include official Salesforce resources and third-party resources that have been provided by the wider Salesforce community. There are resources that require some level of payment and some that are free for both the official and third-party resources.</p><p>If you are fortunate to be currently working with the Salesforce CRM platform for a Salesforce customer or partner and have system administrator permission, then you should be able to gain valuable on-the-job experience and will be able to gain much of the knowledge of the features and functionality whilst carrying out your day job.</p><p>For individuals that may not currently be full-time system administrators in their company, but work for organizations with a training budget and a desire to train them in the role of Salesforce administrator, these individuals can take advantage of the instructor-led training courses that are produced by Salesforce. Also, individuals who are able to pay for their own training can attend these official instructor-led Salesforce training courses.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note355"/>Note</h3><p>Salesforce recommends carrying out on-the-job experience, attending training course(s), and self-study to help improve an individual's chances of passing the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Official Salesforce resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec320"/>Official Salesforce resources</h3></div></div></div><p>The official Salesforce resources for training and studying for the Certified Administrator exam are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Instructor-led and Online Certified Administrator training courses</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Premier Support Online Courses</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce Developer Edition</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Trailhead</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Official online and social networking channels</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Salesforce Certified Administrator Study Guide</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Instructor-led and Online Certified Administrator training courses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl4sec76"/>Instructor-led and Online Certified Administrator training courses</h4></div></div></div><p>Some people find it easier to learn in a classroom-based environment where they are guided through an agenda of Salesforce CRM administration.</p><p>In this type of class, students are able to carry out practical tasks while under the supervision of a skilled training professional with Salesforce certification skills.

What should a system administrator use to disable access to a custom application for a group of users? Choose one answer:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>a</strong></span>) Profiles</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>b</strong></span>) Sharing rules</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>c</strong></span>) Web tabs</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>d</strong></span>) Page layouts</p><p>2. Universal Containers needs to track the manufacturer and model for specific car companies.How can the system administrator ensure that the manufacturer selected influences the values available for the model? Choose one answer:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>a</strong></span>) Create the manufacturer field as a dependent picklist and the model as a controlling picklist.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>b</strong></span>) Create a lookup field from the manufacturer object to the model object.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>c</strong></span>) Create the manufacturer field as a controlling picklist and the model as a dependent picklist.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>d</strong></span>) Create a multi-select picklist field that includes both manufacturers and models.</p><p>3. Sales representatives at Universal Containers need assistance from product managers when selling certain products. Product managers do not have access to opportunities, but need to gain access when they are assisting with a specific deal. How can a system administrator accomplish this? Choose one answer:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>a</strong></span>) Notify the product manager using opportunity update reminders.</p><p>

Do not bring too much baggage into the testing center as you only have a small locker in which to store all your personal belongings.</p><p>You will need to take two forms of identifying details, which can be your passport and driving license. In addition, you need to either print the e-mail that you received when you registered for the exam, or show the test code to the examination room proctor as they will need the code to start the exam.

It is worth reading the questions slowly as it is quite easy to make a snap judgement.
