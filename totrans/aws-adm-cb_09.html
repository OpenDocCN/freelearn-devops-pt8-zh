<p>One of the hardest things to get used to when starting with AWS is that you pay for almost everything that you use. One of the biggest benefits of AWS is that you only pay for what you use. This makes it hard to quickly answer the <em>how much is it going to cost?</em> question that often arises when people first start using AWS; they don't know exactly what they currently use!</p>
<p>In a <em>traditional</em> infrastructure or data center setup, many costs are paid during the initial outlay or in annual contracts. As AWS has no upfront fees, and few long-term commitments, so the usual thought process around costs is turned on its head.</p>
<p>There are a number of helpful tools to get a better estimate of your AWS usage costs. Don't forget that every AWS service page has a pricing section. While some pricing models can be a bit confusing at the start, it quickly makes sense.</p>

<p>AWS Simple Monthly Calculator is a website application provided to help you estimate and forecast your AWS costs. By listing the resources you expect to consume you can calculate your pay-as-you-go costs, which is how AWS bills you<span><span>—</span></span>there's no upfront costs involved.</p>

<p>In order to use the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator effectively, you need to already know the specific services and resources that you will use on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>You also need to know specifics about things such as monthly data transfer and the amount of data you will need to store. In AWS, you get charged for data in and out of AWS (for example, visitors to your website), but not between AWS services (for example, EC2 instances to RDS databases).</p>

<p>The accuracy of the calculator is completely dependent on your ability to forecast your requirements and usage<span><span>—</span></span>not an easy thing to do when you first start using AWS!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all AWS services are present in the calculator (a notable exception is AWS Lambda). For those services, you will have to do your own calculations based on the service-specific pricing pages.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The cost of services and resources can vary from region to region. In general, the <kbd>us-east-1</kbd> region is the cheapest, and also has the most services (not all services are available in all regions), so use that if you want to know the lowest-cost option. Other regions' prices vary due to supply and demand, cost of operations, and undoubtedly many other reasons that AWS doesn't go in to.</div>
<p>Some services (for example, DynamoDB, Lambda, and so on) have a free tier that applies even if your account does not qualify for the <em>standard</em> free tier (that is, the account is more than 12 months old). These services will have a note on their specific calculator page detailing the inclusions:</p>
<div class="packt_figure"><img class="image-border" src="assets/B06236_09_09.png"/></div>
<p>Once completed, you can generate a specific URL for your estimation report that you can share with anyone. There's no authentication to access this URL, so don't put any sensitive information in your reports. The only protection is that the URL is unlikely to be guessed (given it's just the calculator site with a GUID parameter).</p>

<p>For this recipe, you will need an existing CloudFormation template. The template does not need to be deployed as a stack;, just the file is required.</p>
<p>In this example, we will use the template from <a href="http://Using%20AWS%20Compute"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></a>, <em>Using AWS Compute</em>, to securely access private instances: <kbd>06-create-database-with-automatic-failover.yaml</kbd>.</p>

<p>The <kbd>estimate-template-cost</kbd> command requires all the parameters of your template. As you can see in the first step, the actual values aren't important because the template won't actually be launched. You simply need to make sure the type of value you give matches the required type for that parameter (for example, the <kbd>SubnetIds</kbd> value must be a list of values in this template).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The region you specify is important! Some services (but not all) can cost different amounts depending on the region they are in. Generally, the <kbd>us-east-1</kbd> region is the cheapest.</div>
<p>At the end of the command, we limit the output to just the report URL via the <kbd>--query</kbd> argument.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can share the URL generated with others, but you will not be able to retrieve earlier reports unless you keep track of the URL yourself.</div>
<p>On the calculator website, the template's resources will be pre-populated, even if you can't immediately see them. The report always defaults to the Amazon EC2 service page, so you will have to go to the relevant service page via the left-hand menu (in this case, Amazon RDS).</p>
<p>Finally, you can see a complete report of your template's monthly cost on the <span class="packt_screen">Estimate of your Monthly Bill</span> tab. If your template contains many different types of resources/services, you will see them summarized here.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Purchasing reserved instances</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>Reserved instances can be the cause of some confusion and are often misunderstood. Here are a few pointers to get you going down the right path:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved instances have no distinguishing technical features compared to regular on-demand instances.</li>
<li>Reserved instances are not a specific type or class of instance.</li>
<li>Put simply, purchasing a reserved instance entitles you to a discounted hourly rate on an on-demand instance that matches the properties of the reserved instance.</li>
<li>The discounted hourly rate will be of a varying size depending on how much you pay upfront. As a general rule, the more you pay upfront, the higher the discount.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you purchase a reserved instance, you're required to specify the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Platform</span> (<span class="packt_screen">Linux</span>/<span class="packt_screen">Windows</span>)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Scope</span> (<span class="packt_screen">Region</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Availability Zone</span>)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Instance Type</span> (for example, <span class="packt_screen">m3.large</span>)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tenancy</span> (shared or dedicated)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Offering Class</span> (standard or convertible)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Term</span> (1-12 months or 1-3 years)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Payment Option</span> (no upfront, partial upfront, all upfront)</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll explore the ins and outs a little more later in this section. For now, let's dive in and see how to make a purchase.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You'll need an AWS account and some idea of which instance types you wish to reserve and for how long. Refer to the reserved instance properties mentioned previously for the exact information you'll need to proceed.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Payment Option</span> you choose will dramatically affect the price you pay when purchasing the reservation:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">No Upfront</span>: This means you pay nothing now but you will be charged the discounted hourly rate for the entire term whether or not you have an instance that matches the reservation. Also note that choosing this option limits you to 1 year for standard reservations and 3 years for convertible reservations (we'll discuss these later in this section).</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Partial Upfront</span>: These reservations mean that you pay a smaller upfront fee and then you are charged a discounted hourly rate only for the instance hours you use.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">All Upfront</span>: As the name suggests, you'll be required to pay the full cost of the instance for the entire term. An effective 100% discount is applied to the hourly rate of your matching instances for that term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know all the properties of the instance reservation, you can go ahead and make a purchase.</p>

<li>Go to the EC2 web console, select <span class="packt_screen">Reserved Instances</span>, then <span class="packt_screen">Purchase Reserved Instances:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure"><img class="image-border" src="assets/B06236_09_13.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>We now need to perform a search for the instance type you wish to purchase. In this example, we're going to choose the following:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Platform</span>: <span class="packt_screen">Linux/UNIX</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tenancy</span>: <span class="packt_screen">Default</span></li>

<li><span class="packt_screen">Payment Option</span>: <span class="packt_screen">All Upfront</span></li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Obviously, choose the options that best match your workload. You almost certainly want to choose <span class="packt_screen">Default</span> as <span class="packt_screen">Tenancy</span> here.

</ol>
<div class="packt_figure"><img class="image-border" src="assets/B06236_09_14.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>The console will return a price for the instance reservation. Note that because we didn't select <span class="packt_screen">Only show offerings that reserve capacity</span>, what we are seeing is a single result, that is a reservation which applies to the region we're currently viewing in the console. Think of this as a <em>region level</em> reservation:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure"><img class="image-border" src="assets/B06236_09_15.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now try selecting <span class="packt_screen">Only show offerings that reserve capacity</span> and notice that all Availability Zones are showing for the current region. You can think of these as <em>AZ level</em> reservations. Choosing one of these options obviously locks you in to a specific <span class="packt_screen">Availability Zone</span>; however, you also get a <em>capacity reservation</em> (discussed next):</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure"><img class="image-border" src="assets/B06236_09_16.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Choose the reservation that looks right for you, and then click <span class="packt_screen">Add to Cart</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">View Cart</span>.</li>
<li>The next page shows a summary of your imminent purchase. Click <span class="packt_screen">Purchase</span> to proceed. Note that this is the point of no return. Reserved instances can't be canceled. Choose wisely!</li>

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>After you've completed your purchase, your reservation will be marked as <span class="packt_screen">Payment Pending</span> and then soon after <span class="packt_screen">Active</span> (there's a third possible status, which is <span class="packt_screen">Retired</span>).</p>
<p>Once your reservation is <span class="packt_screen">Active</span>, the discount will automatically apply to matching instances. AWS refers to this hourly discount as a <em>billing benefit</em>.</p>
<p>Choosing a <span class="packt_screen">Convertible</span> reservation class immediately rules out anything but a 3 year term. In return, you get a little more flexibility than the <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span> reservations because if you decide the reservation no longer meets your needs, you can <em>convert</em> it to a reservation that is of equal or higher value, paying the difference of course.</p>
<p>If you made a reservation for a specific Availability Zone, AWS also provides you with a <em>capacity reservation</em>, which will give you some guarantees around the availability of instances in that zone. This is something you might want to consider if your workload needs to maintain a certain amount of capacity in the event of an entire Availability Zone outage, for example. An event such as this tends to cause a rush of new instance requests in the unaffected zones; however, customers without a capacity reservation may find their new instance requests can't be fulfilled because of a lack of capacity (this is not unheard of), causing them to miss out or forcing them to issue new instance requests for a different zone and/or instance type while at the same time crossing their fingers.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Unlike the <em>billing benefit</em> (hourly discount), which is applied immediately after purchase, a capacity reservation is used by the first instance you launch in the zone matching the properties of your reservation.</div>

<li>Services that launch instances on your behalf (auto scaling, Elastic Beanstalk, and so on) are also eligible to have hourly discounts applied to them.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Standard</span> reservations can be made for either 1 or 3 years. As mentioned before, <span class="packt_screen">Convertible</span> reservations are fixed at 3 years.</li>
<li>Under a consolidated billing model, reserved instances discounts are applied across all your sub accounts. For example, if you purchase a reserved instance intended for account A but there is no server matching its properties, the reservation will automatically apply to matching instances in account B. This only applies to the billing benefit and not the capacity benefit.</li>
<li>Reserved instances can be sold in the AWS marketplace. This is useful if the reservation no longer suits your needs. Note that you will need a US bank account for this.</li>
<li>If reserved instances don't seem to match your type of workload, you might consider a scheduled instance instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The AWS TCO Calculator is designed to provide you with a ballpark view of how much it will cost you to run equivalent infrastructure on AWS in comparison to your co-located or on-premise data center.</p>
<p>The calculator has been audited by an independent third-party, but you should of course check its output against your own calculations before you make any purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>The calculator will take your server requirements and map them to EC2 instances of an appropriate size. Since we've been specific that we need an object store for our storage, it will calculate our storage costs based on the price for S3 storage in our region.</p>

<p>Let's take a look under the hood and see how we're able to save so much money on AWS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prices for our EC2 instances are based on a 3 year reserved instance price with a partial upfront payment. Is this a fair comparison? Yes and no. You would probably be locked in to a fixed hardware contract with your on-premise or co-located solution, so it makes sense to apply similar contract terms to your AWS pricing model. In reality, you'd probably want to think about purchasing reserved instances <em>after</em> you've moved to AWS and performed some fine tuning around which instance types to use. On the flip side, the AWS costs could be reduced even further if your servers ran under <span class="packt_screen">All Upfront</span> instance reservations.</li>
<li>The comparison of object storage systems may or may not be fair depending on the feature set of your on-premise or co-located solution. For example, S3 has the ability to apply an <em>infrequently accessed</em> storage class on stored objects, which reduces their cost but also (theoretically) slightly reduces their availability. You'd probably not have this feature in your on-premise or co-located storage.</li>
<li>The 3 year cost for storage in our on-premise/co-located facility is AU $69,660, of which a whopping 97% of that is the <em>monthly cost to operate a rack</em>. This includes rental of space, cooling, power, and so on.</li>
<li>While the cost calculator is taking a purely infrastructure view, it also does factor in support costs. If you are new to AWS, you will probably be leaning on AWS support a little bit to get up and running.</li>
<li>You'll also want to factor in some costs around training and potentially hiring staff who are skilled in deploying and migrating systems to AWS. Your developers are also going to start thinking differently about how to build and deploy their applications. Make sure to factor this in too.</li>
<li>If you aren't totally happy with the on-premise or co-location estimates, you can go ahead and change the figures used in the calculation. Scroll to the top of the page and click <span class="packt_screen">Modify Assumptions</span> to input your own hardware prices:</li>
