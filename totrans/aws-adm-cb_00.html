<p>The AWS platform is growing at a rapid rate, and it's being increasingly adopted across all industries and sectors. As the saying goes, friends don't let friends build data centers. No matter how you look at it, the model of pay-as-you-go compute, network, and storage is here to stay. It's also becoming increasingly hard to argue against <em>standing on the shoulders of giants</em>, especially when you look the rate with which features and enhancements are added to the AWS platform compared to what you'd typically get out of other cloud providers or a so-called <em>private</em> cloud.</p>
<p>We work with a lot of technical professionals who are highly knowledgeable in their domain, but often completely new to the AWS platform. Alternatively, they might be familiar with AWS but new to automation and infrastructure code practices.</p>
<p>We wanted to write a book for these people.</p>
<p>This book is intended to kick-start your AWS journey by providing recipes, patterns, and best practices across the areas we are often asked to help with on our consulting engagements. All the recipes and recommendations contained in this book are based on our personal experiences and observations from our time helping customers on the AWS platform.</p>
<p>CloudFormation is the AWS-native method for automating the (repeatable and reliable) deployment of AWS resources, and we use it extensively throughout this book. The recipes that follow will help you get well acquainted with CloudFormation, and you'll soon be on your way to customizing and building your own templates. With so much power at your fingertips, there's a lot of potential for finding yourself in a rabbit hole. This book aims to steer you in the right direction and help you adopt the platform in a sustainable and maintainable way.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "You should now have an active session under <kbd>PowerUserRole</kbd> in the application account."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
Parameters:<br/>  EC2KeyName:<br/>    Type: String<br/>    Description: EC2 Key Pair to launch with
</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
Parameters:<br/>  EC2KeyName:<br/>    <strong>Type: String</strong><br/>    Description: EC2 Key Pair to launch with
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --output json </strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
