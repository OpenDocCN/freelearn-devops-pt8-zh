- en: 'As organizations continue to leverage cloud technologies, there has been a
    remarkable shift in the way cloud services are consumed through different cloud
    models. Recent studies and experiences have shown an increase in the need to adopt
    a mixed approach to using managed services across multiple vendors at the same
    time. Following the **multi-cloud** track has become a top trend where enterprises
    seek the best options to accommodate their workloads in the most efficient and
    optimized ways. In the previous parts of the book, we have demonstrated the position
    of OpenStack in cloud parlance. However, for many organizations, running only
    a private cloud environment might not be sufficient to satisfy all business requirements.
    Similarly, public cloud providers offer a wider range of service layers including
    **Infrastructure as a Service** ( **IaaS** ), **Platform as a Service** ( **PaaS**
    ), and **Software as a Service** ( **SaaS** ). However, some companies may not
    consume all services publicly for specific reasons. OpenStack’s private cloud
    might be the answer to start a cloud journey but, for whatever reason, it might
    not be enough. The compromise found for several organizations is to adopt a hybrid
    approach where both public and private clouds are used. As we have a running private
    cloud based on OpenStack, this chapter will expand the OpenStack perimeter by
    going through the following topics:'

    *public* means *available over the internet* , organizations just needed to access
    a self-service portal to provision infrastructure on demand and enjoy elasticity
    and infinite scalability. Major cloud providers such as **Amazon Web Services**
    ( **AWS** ), **Microsoft Azure** , and **Google Cloud Platform** ( **GCP** ) keep
    extending the number of managed services in regular cycles. Public cloud consumers
    benefit from each new managed service that reduces operational overheads and consumes
    services with less effort and even with less required expertise. A presence around
    the world is another important deal for many organizations that are active globally.
    Most of the big public cloud providers have built dozens of data centers across
    several regions worldwide, making them an attractive option to support businesses
    in different locations. Hence, developers can focus on the business logic of the
    application. They can also run experimentation at a lower cost without spending
    an immense budget upfront. The public cloud has also solved the *agility mystery*
    in which startups and medium enterprises have been struggling to afford an infrastructure
    that could provide agility. Although the term *DevOps* existed even before the
    public cloud revolution, the lack of tools and, hence, the infrastructure that
    can leverage the whole agile software life cycle has been a major barrier. Before
    the introduction of the public cloud realm, the **Infrastructure as Code** ( **IaC**
    ) concept was just a theory.

- en: A gazillion advantages can be noted from adopting a public cloud approach. On
    the other hand, after a few months and years of consuming public cloud services,
    organizations have started observing a few shortcomings. The adoption of the public
    cloud is based on a **pay-as-you-go** model; this is what has convinced enterprises
    that it is the right choice to reduce the costs of traditional infrastructure.
    However, if it is not carefully analyzed, it could be more expensive than planned.
    Whether a business is migrating to the cloud or is born in it, as reflected in
    the approaches to investment, building a business case and determining the **Return
    On Investment** ( **ROI** ) is a must-do practice that should be done at the start
    of the journey. A simple business case should look at the capital expenditure
    and cost when leveraging public cloud resources per workload. For example, an
    application can run on top of one or several virtual machines. A virtual machine
    that assumingly runs 100% of the time can keep a linear cost curve. If this is
    not carefully tagged and tracked from the cost point of view, operation teams
    can easily lose track of where the budget is spent. **Hyperscaler** providers
    offer transparent billing options and more granular cost breakdown views to help
    customers understand their usage. However, in most cases, optimizing workload
    spending would require some changes to its architecture and infrastructure components.
    The fear of such changes breaking things in production could discourage operators
    from taking that experimental cost optimization step. Cost in the public cloud
    world can be a major disadvantage if it is not estimated in advance. For that
    reason, a **Financial Operations** ( **FinOps** ) discipline has been created
    that aims to make financial accountability to the cloud a collective matter between
    IT, finance, and business teams. To read more about FinOps, you can check the

  zh: 采用公有云方法可以带来无数的优势。另一方面，经过几个月和几年的公有云服务使用后，组织开始注意到一些不足之处。公有云的采用是基于**按需付费**模式；正是这种模式让企业相信它是减少传统基础设施成本的正确选择。然而，如果没有仔细分析，它可能比预期的更昂贵。无论一个企业是迁移到云端，还是天生就是云端企业，如同投资方法所体现的那样，建立商业案例和确定**投资回报率**（**ROI**）是必须在旅程开始时就进行的实践。一个简单的商业案例应该考虑到利用公有云资源时每个工作负载的资本支出和成本。例如，一个应用可以运行在一个或多个虚拟机之上。假设一台虚拟机
    100% 的时间都在运行，那么它的成本曲线将保持线性。如果从成本角度没有仔细标记和跟踪，这样操作团队很容易失去对预算花费的控制。**超级云服务提供商**提供透明的计费选项和更细粒度的成本拆解视图，帮助客户理解他们的使用情况。然而，在大多数情况下，优化工作负载支出需要对其架构和基础设施组件进行一些更改。担心这些更改可能会导致生产环境出现问题，可能会使操作人员不敢采取实验性的成本优化措施。在公有云中，如果事先没有估算好，成本可能成为一个主要的劣势。因此，**财务运维**（**FinOps**）学科应运而生，旨在让云端的财务责任成为
    IT、财务和业务团队之间的集体事务。欲了解更多有关 FinOps 的信息，您可以访问官方的 FinOps 基金会网站，网址是[https://www.finops.org/](https://www.finops.org/)

- en: The next issue with public cloud usage is security and compliance concerns.
    When public cloud providers started exposing managed services, security teams
    brought forth questions about where and how the data was being transferred and
    stored. Although public providers have clarified their compliance certifications
    that prove their underlying infrastructure security, several organizations are
    still not comfortable spreading their data in locations other than their own data
    centers. We know that some compliance controls, such as **Sarbanes-Oxley** ( **SOX**
    ), **International Standards Organization** **(ISO** ), and so on, are well supported
    by public cloud providers. However, organizations that operate around the globe
    should have a hosting infrastructure compliant with each region that is running
    its business. Taking the example of the **General Data Protection Regulation**
    ( **GDPR** ) compliance standard within the **European Union** ( **EU** ), cloud
    providers such as AWS had to take rigorous measurements to protect data for transfer
    from the EU to non-EU countries and regions. Hence, any region other than the
    EU must also comply with it.

  zh: 公有云使用中的另一个问题是安全性和合规性问题。当公有云提供商开始提供托管服务时，安全团队提出了关于数据传输和存储的地点和方式的问题。尽管公有云提供商已经澄清了其合规性认证，证明其底层基础设施的安全性，但许多组织仍不愿将数据分散存储在自己数据中心以外的地方。我们知道，一些合规控制，如**萨班斯-奥克斯利法案**（**SOX**）、**国际标准化组织**（**ISO**）等，得到了公有云提供商的良好支持。然而，全球范围内运营的组织应该拥有符合其经营所在地区的托管基础设施。以**欧洲联盟**（**EU**）内的**通用数据保护条例**（**GDPR**）合规标准为例，像AWS这样的云提供商必须采取严格的措施，保护数据从欧盟传输到非欧盟国家和地区。因此，欧盟以外的任何地区也必须遵守此规定。

- en: The next concerning point on the list is the lack of full control over the cloud
    infrastructure. At first glance, the preceding diagram might seem counterintuitive.
    The fact that organizations are looking for a public cloud offering is mainly
    due to running faster time to market without the need to get their hands into
    the hardware details or underlying networking devices. That can be a fair reason
    to adopt the public cloud, but what about when we need the customization of the
    underlying hardware? As that is managed only by the vendor, consumers will not
    have control over it. That might sound odd from the first reflection, but compared
    to traditional on-premises models, sometimes application teams ask for certain
    hardware combinations with granular specifications that cannot be found in the
    public cloud. Network teams, in some edge cases, could be asked to build a network
    map that is not convenient in the public cloud world. Coming from the on-premises
    world, cloud consumers might have some expectations of having a certain degree
    of control of the underlying infrastructure that is not feasible at the beginning.
    That can turn into accepting such limitations at the cost of architecting a complex
    network setup. On the other hand, some cloud providers have responded to many
    customers’ requests and provided certain ways of controlling how hardware can
    be provisioned to run specific workloads. For example, AWS offers a **dedicated
    instances** feature that allows for running a bunch of EC2 instances on hardware
    that is dedicated to a single AWS environment and isolates them from sharing the
    underlying physical machines with other instances belonging to other AWS environments.
    Although cloud providers are aware of such limits, which is the purpose of the
    **managed services model** , enterprises keep seeking the maximum number of ways
    of having control over the cloud to achieve the best results.

  zh: 列表中的下一个关注点是缺乏对云基础设施的完全控制。从表面上看，前面的图表可能显得不太直观。组织选择公有云服务的主要原因是可以更快地将产品推向市场，无需深入了解硬件细节或底层网络设备。这是采用公有云的一个合理原因，但当我们需要定制底层硬件时怎么办？由于这仅由供应商管理，消费者将无法控制它。从第一反应来看，这可能显得有些奇怪，但与传统的本地部署模式相比，有时应用团队会要求某些硬件组合和细化的规格，而这些在公有云中无法找到。在某些边缘情况下，网络团队可能会被要求构建在公有云环境下不方便实现的网络拓扑图。来自本地部署环境的云消费者可能对底层基础设施有一定的控制期望，而这在初期是不可行的。这可能变成接受这些限制，代价是构建一个复杂的网络设置。另一方面，一些云服务商已经回应了许多客户的需求，提供了控制硬件配置的方式，以便运行特定工作负载。例如，AWS
    提供了 **专用实例** 功能，允许在专门为单一 AWS 环境提供的硬件上运行一批 EC2 实例，并将这些实例与其他 AWS 环境中的实例隔离，避免它们共享底层物理机器。虽然云服务提供商已经意识到这些限制，这也是
    **托管服务模式** 的目的，但企业仍在不断寻找更多方式来控制云环境，以达到最佳效果。
- en: The last public cloud drawback point is the vendor lock-in dilemma. Protection
    from lock-in situations is a major requirement for most enterprises that seek
    to be *infrastructure-agnostic* before being *cloud-agnostic* . Moving freely
    between environments and platforms is a luxury driver for many businesses to stay
    economical with resource usage and respond to development requirements when needed.
    Lock-in can take different forms. For example, let’s say that an organization
    wishes to move its workload running on a virtual machine between different cloud
    providers or on-premises. That would require a longer time for planning and testing
    before doing such a move, such as building a private connection between the cloud
    source and the environment destination(s), building the application artifact,
    deploying it in the target environment, and testing it. The good news, thanks
    to some amazing open source initiatives, is that containerization technology has
    been a rockstar that has enabled standardized application deployment to a certain
    degree. Hence, moving between environments is a matter of connecting them with
    a shared container registry. The other vendor lock-in form is the way of managing
    the infrastructure itself. We have highlighted previously how the IaC concept
    started shining only when the public cloud went into action. As soon as more services
    and resources became overwhelming to manage, public cloud providers built the
    right managed service to codify the infrastructure. We can find, for example,
    **CloudFormation** in AWS, **Azure Deployment Manager** in Azure, and **Cloud
    Deployment Manager** in GCP. If you land in AWS and start writing code templates
    for your AWS resources, it won’t be a viable option if you later plan to use the
    same code abstract in GCP or Azure. Being cloud-agnostic when it comes to IaC
    is almost a religious matter for many enterprises. In many cases, those enterprises
    skip learning any of those resource management tools and stick to cloud-agnostic
    ones such as **Terraform** and **Pulumi** .

  zh: 公共云的最后一个缺点是供应商锁定困境。防止被锁定的情况是大多数企业在追求*基础设施无关*之前需要*云无关*的主要要求。能够在不同环境和平台之间自由切换，是许多企业为了保持资源使用经济性并在需要时响应开发需求的奢侈驱动因素。锁定有不同的表现形式。例如，假设一个组织希望在不同的云提供商或本地环境之间迁移其运行在虚拟机上的工作负载。为了进行这种迁移，在执行之前需要更多的计划和测试，例如在云源和目标环境之间建立专用连接，构建应用程序工件，将其部署到目标环境并进行测试。好消息是，得益于一些了不起的开源倡议，容器化技术成为了推动标准化应用部署的明星，使得在环境之间的迁移变得更为简单。现在，环境之间的迁移只需要通过共享的容器注册表进行连接。另一种供应商锁定的形式是基础设施管理的方式。我们之前已经强调过，只有当公共云投入使用时，IaC（基础设施即代码）概念才开始崭露头角。随着更多的服务和资源变得难以管理，公共云提供商构建了适当的托管服务来编写基础设施代码。例如，我们可以在AWS中找到**CloudFormation**，在Azure中找到**Azure
    Deployment Manager**，在GCP中找到**Cloud Deployment Manager**。如果你进入AWS并开始为你的AWS资源编写代码模板，那么如果你以后计划在GCP或Azure中使用相同的代码抽象，这将不可行。对于许多企业而言，IaC的云无关性几乎是一个宗教问题。在很多情况下，这些企业跳过了学习任何这些资源管理工具，而坚持使用像**Terraform**和**Pulumi**这样的云无关工具。

    You might run a workload between two or more different clouds supporting multiple
    APIs of the same kind with the same technology stack. That can be less complex
    to run with easier implementation. The other variation is when different clouds
    do not support the same kind of APIs with different types of components, such
    as database engines or types of hypervisors. In this case, more tweaking is required
    to increase the degree of complexity. The good news is that OpenStack has been
    designed to leverage some of the public cloud capabilities. The secret sauce is
    its rich API exposure. As a private cloud software, OpenStack is considered a
    good choice that can power the network of private and public clouds. OpenStack
    is leveraged to manage resources for other public cloud providers such as AWS.
    For example, OpenStack supports a few drivers for AWS such as Nova for EC2, Neutron
    for VPC, and Cinder driver for EBS in AWS. Those drivers come under the **OpenStack-Omni**

    requirements. Some organizations might dictate in which region and cloud they
    wish to host their applications. Others might prefer to deploy their services
    on one cloud or the other, but data (including databases or big data) must reside
    in a private cloud environment or even on-premises bare metal. Anything else that
    does not include data can run on the public cloud. With this variety of requirements,
    cloud operators should find a hybrid model that can fit each workload’s needs.
    With the rich set of APIs of OpenStack, integration with the automation tools
    and external APIs of other vendors makes it easy to run as a hybrid with the least
    risk of vendor lock-in. By gaining such flexibility, growing the business application
    is no longer a concern to run in any public or private cloud environment. For
    example, let’s say that an organization develops a service that gets packed on
    a container image. The image is deployed in a private OpenStack cloud environment
    and, quickly, a global presence of the application becomes a business requirement
    with a larger audience. That is where bursting comes into play. The workload would
    burst into a public cloud by using its resources in the nearest requested region.
    With the right design, cloud architects should be able to make any application
    live in both worlds and take advantage of the hybrid model capabilities without
    being locked into one model. Cloud bursting is a very common use case of a hybrid
    cloud, and is even considered a hybrid feature in other literature. As shown in

    cloud infrastructures to more rapidly process sudden increases in requests and

    and responds to additional load by spreading it to public cloud resources. Cloud
    bursting is essentially a dynamic deployment of workloads to increase elasticity
    and scalability in peak times once the private cloud resource demand becomes overwhelming.
    The common pattern of cloud bursting is that companies rely primarily on their
    private cloud resources and enable bursting only during traffic spikes to accommodate
    the additional load. Once the sudden surge of the workload spike is over, public
    cloud resources are terminated and the application keeps running only in the private
    cloud environment.

    the private and public clouds. In a hybrid model, cloud operators would review
    what is offered from a security standpoint. To a certain extent, security in a
    hybrid model can be enforced more when leveraging the private part, but additional
    threats can be observed with insecure API endpoints, data leaks, or missing encryption
    at rest and in transit. In the OpenStack world, cloud operators should think of
    the security *of* the private cloud, whereas security *in* the cloud is the task
    of the user. Following a security discipline would not differ from pure private
    or public clouds when dealing with a hybrid cloud environment. Starting with the
    principle of **zero-trust** , cloud architects should take security as a core
    principle at the earliest stage when designing a hybrid environment, in the same
    way as building a private cloud. In a hybrid setup, more components are involved
    in the security configuration. Based on a zero-trust approach, any entity of the
    architecture is considered a threat by default, including user access, workloads,
    data, network devices, and traffic. If you have ensured that your private cloud
    based on OpenStack is following the same approach, you would just need to combine
    the security boundaries of the cloud provider and shared responsibilities. The
    good news is that most hyperscaler providers have defined a shared responsibility
    model. Boundary responsibilities should be clarified at the start of the hybrid
    cloud journey. For example, if a user is looking at a SaaS solution that is not
    supported by the private OpenStack cloud, the security responsibility is shifted
    to the target public cloud provider. Several entities are engaged when defining
    a shared responsibility based on a hybrid cloud setup, including hardware, storage,
    encryption, physical network, guest operating system, network and platform security,
    data location, user authentication, and authorization, to name a few.

    rules of data privacy requirements and cloud users are responsible for adhering
    to them. Cloud providers should comply with defined rules of data protection,
    which will vary from one region to another. Taking the example of GDPR rules,
    the hybrid cloud should provide the insurance of data protection within the EU,
    including data privacy, residency, and retention. In a hybrid world, a mix of
    a private cloud based on OpenStack and a public cloud should be aligned with the

    compliance requirement but rather to several due to the mixed nature of such a
    public and private combination. Such a process can be error-prone if not all governance
    measures are checked before starting to receive workloads. For this matter, it
    is essential to spend a good time establishing a well-secured platform between
    both private and public clouds. A containerized application can be easier to deploy
    across private and public clouds. We have covered the maturity of the OpenStack
    ecosystem when dealing with containers in previous chapters. For example, spreading
    a containerized application across an OpenStack private cloud and a public cloud
    environment should prompt the following governance and compliance considerations:'

    as each workload would present different compliance requirements. Standardizing
    the rules defined for the cloud infrastructure can reduce such complexity but
    requires a deep understanding of analyzing the perimeter of responsibility of
    each public cloud provider. From a private cloud perspective running OpenStack,
    you should have already a greater view of all pieces of the security puzzle when
    designing the private cloud.

    a workload in the cloud of any type. The public cloud provides gazillions of ways
    to design networks for workloads and it is down to the cloud user to define the
    network perimeter. If the application is made to be publicly accessible, cloud
    users would leverage internet gateways or appliances to expose the application
    in its virtual network. Hybrid environments will be required to provide the maximum
    degree of flexibility for networking options. As we have seen in the OpenStack
    world, the underlying infrastructure includes not only the physical routers and
    switches but also an overlay network layer on top of the physical network infrastructure
    (software-defined networks). With both network layers (physical and overlay) being
    virtual, private cloud operators should consider ways of segmenting networks while
    keeping full control. The underlying network security layer that is not visible
    to cloud users must exist before hosting any workload. That can be achieved by
    leveraging firewalls or by putting web application firewalls in place to protect
    against DDoS threats. Similarly, public cloud providers ensure (based on the shared
    responsibility model) a certain level of network security, including hardware
    and traffic management. Traffic circulating within the public provider backbone
    is considered trusted, but it is down to the cloud users to define how the application
    will be isolated or made public. Either way, network services are provided to
    control the type of traffic within its network boundary or in wider exposure.
    If you are scaling an application between a private and public cloud, a variety
    of network security mechanisms must exist, which can be summarized as follows:'

    of the previous point whereby an application can reach any cloud in the hybrid
    environment through a private connection without traversing the internet. Taking
    the example of a Kubernetes cluster, pods in an OpenStack environment can reach
    other pods of the same cluster context in AWS via a private connection such as
    **DirectConnect** or a **VPN** . Cloud operators would need to define the different
    routes to reach each of the cloud endpoints so the application components’ interconnectivity
    stays private even across different cloud environments.

    implementations. Looking at the network security aspect requires solid preparation
    for securing endpoints for both private and public clouds. The private part would
    require more hardening as a cloud operator has a full hand on the network infrastructure.
    In our case, securing the API endpoints in each service in the OpenStack private
    cloud is a must. The OpenStack community provides an updated version of a security
    guide upon each new release that is worth visiting. The API endpoint security
    guide can be found at [https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/api-endpoints/api-endpoint-configuration-recommendations.html](https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/api-endpoints/api-endpoint-configuration-recommendations.html)

    We have dedicated the second chapter in this edition to illustrating how DevSecOps
    is an essential style to automate security in the operation of an OpenStack infrastructure.

    in all different infrastructures requires additional controls. Data handling should
    be carefully performed as improper data movement can raise major data leakages
    that are not easy to recover. The other challenge of hybrid implementation is
    the complexity of access management. Users will need to be authenticated and authorized
    in a flexible way that grants access across multiple infrastructures. Using **Identity
    and Access Management** ( **IAM** ) coupled with single sign-on tools can help
    to remediate access complexity challenges.

    cloud capacity, there is always an opportunity to reach public cloud environments
    and construct a hybrid environment, as we learned in this chapter. The latter
    model keeps expanding as a new cloud style as enterprises have felt the necessity
    to have combined cloud modes to enjoy each type of cloud’s benefits. We learned
    that recent cloud experiences have shown that a multi-cloud strategy is still
    not enough to fill cost gaps in addition to compliance concerns. The increase
    of the hybrid model dominance has been accompanied by more additional OpenStack
    private cloud implementations. Gaining skills to build and manage an OpenStack
    private cloud is one of the cornerstones to moving to a hybrid model, which is
    why we focused on this in this chapter. Furthermore, we learned that OpenStack
    provides various cloud capabilities and, thanks to its rich APIs, our private
    cloud can integrate well into a hybrid cloud model.
