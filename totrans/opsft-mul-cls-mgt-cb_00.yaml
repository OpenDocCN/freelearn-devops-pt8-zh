- en: We are living in a world of such big and rapid changes. In the IT industry,
    things such as **DevOps**, **the cloud**, **digital transformation**, **containers**,
    and **Kubernetes** have emerged in the last few years and dramatically changed
    the way we develop, build, test, and deploy applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among the big set of new technologies, only a few of them have become a sort
    of *consensus* in the industry, including the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes.
    Over the last few years, the authors of this book have worked with many customers
    that are on this cloud and container adoption journey – *almost all of them have
    adopted some sort of Kubernetes distribution and one or more cloud providers*.
    Most of them are *experiencing the benefits* of this adoption but also have to
    deal with *many new challenges*, such as *maintaining standard environments, keeping
    them secure, and keeping costs under control*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is why we decided to focus this book not *only* on OpenShift, which is
    one of the market leaders in enterprise Kubernetes, but *also* on **multi-cluster
    management**. This book is the result of *years of experience in the field*, designing
    architectures and deploying and operating OpenShift clusters, which we have tried
    to turn into words, pages, and chapters!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are going to cover in this book answers to questions such as, *what are the
    different architectural choices I have with OpenShift? How do I design the right
    architecture for my case? What are the different personas related to OpenShift,
    their main responsibilities, and their challenges?* We will also walk through
    **OpenShift deployment, troubleshooting, network, and security**. **CI/CD** and
    **GitOps** are also covered in this book with some *practical examples* that you
    can use to learn how they can help you to increase the maturity level of your
    build and deployment process. Finally, we will go over some tools, such as **Advanced
    Cluster Management** and **Advanced Cluster Security**, that will help you to
    *manage and secure multiple OpenShift clusters from a central standpoint*.

- en: This book is intended to be helpful for any professional that is involved with
    Kubernetes and OpenShift. It is especially useful for software engineers, infrastructure
    operators, developers, site reliability engineers, and security engineers, but
    should also be relevant to enterprise architects and CXO decision makers. Are
    you interested in knowing more about OpenShift architecture, deployment, security,
    GitOps, pipelines, multi-cluster management, and security? *If so, this book was
    carefully made for you!*
