<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Managing Users and Controlling System Access">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Managing Users and Controlling System Access</em></span>, we were introduced to the profile feature in Salesforce, which is a controlling mechanism. Profiles are used to determine the functions users can perform, what types of data they can access, and what operations they can carry out on that data.</p><p>In this chapter, we will describe the Salesforce CRM record storage features and customizable user interface in detail, such as objects, fields, and page layouts. In addition, we will see an overview of the relationship that exists between the profile and these customizable features that the profile controls.</p><p>This chapter looks at the methods for configuring and tailoring the application to suit the way your company information can be best represented within the Salesforce CRM application. We will look at the mechanisms that allow data to be grouped and presented within the application by looking at apps, tabs, page layouts, record types, related lists, and list views.</p><p>Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM administration in the area of Standard and Custom Objects which are covered in this chapter.</p><p>The following topics are being covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Objects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Object relationships</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tabs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Renaming labels for standard tabs, standard objects, and standard fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating custom objects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Object limits</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating custom object relationships</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating custom fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dependent picklists</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building relationship fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lookup relationship options</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Master-detail relationship options</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lookup filters</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building formulas</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Basic formula</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Advanced formula</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building formulas - best practices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building formula text and compiled character size limits</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Custom field governance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Page layouts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Feed-based page layouts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Record types</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Related lists</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="The relationship between a profile and the features that it controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec34"/>The relationship between a profile and the features that it controls</h1></div></div></div><p>The following diagram describes the relationship that exists between a profile and the features that it controls:</p><p>

Standard objects that are available include <span class="strong"><strong>Account</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Contact</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Opportunity</strong></span>. Standard objects are described in more detail later in this chapter.</p><p>In addition to the standard objects, you can create custom objects and custom tabs.</p></div><div class="section" title="Custom objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec88"/>Custom objects</h2></div></div></div><p>Custom objects are the tables you create to store your data. You can create a custom object to store data specific to your organization. Once you have the custom objects and have created records for these objects, you can also create reports and dashboards based on the record data in your custom object.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec36"/>Fields</h1></div></div></div><p>Fields in Salesforce are similar in concept to a database column; they store the data for the object records.

Standard fields cannot be deleted but non-required standard fields can be removed from page layouts whenever necessary.</p><p>With standard fields, you can customize visual elements that are associated with the field, such as field labels and field-level help, as well as certain data definitions such as picklist values, the formatting of auto-number fields (which are used as unique identifiers for the records), and setting of field history tracking. Some aspects, however, such as the field name, cannot be customized and some standard fields (such as <span class="strong"><strong>Opportunity Probability</strong></span>) do not allow the changing of the field label.</p></div><div class="section" title="Custom fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec90"/>Custom fields</h2></div></div></div><p>Custom fields are unique to your business needs and can not only be added and amended, but also deleted. Creating custom fields allow you to store the information that is necessary for your organization.</p><p>Both standard and custom fields can be customized to include custom help text to help users understand how to use the field:</p><p>

<div class="section" title="Object relationships"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec37"/>Object relationships</h1></div></div></div><p>Object relationships can be set on both standard and custom objects and are used to define how records in one object relate to records in another object. <span class="strong"><strong>Accounts</strong></span>, for example, can have a one-to-many relationship with opportunities; these relationships are presented in the application as related lists.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec38"/>Apps</h1></div></div></div><p>An app in Salesforce is a container for all the objects, tabs, processes, and services associated with a business function.</p><p>There are standard and custom apps that are accessed using the <span class="strong"><strong>App menu</strong></span> located at the top-right corner of the Salesforce page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_03_003.jpg" alt="Apps"/></div><p>
</p><p>When users select an app from the <span class="strong"><strong>App</strong></span> menu, their screen changes to present the objects associated with that app. For example, when switching from an app that contains the <span class="strong"><strong>Campaign</strong></span> tab to one that does not, the <span class="strong"><strong>Campaign</strong></span> tab no longer appears. This feature is applied to both standard and custom apps.</p><div class="section" title="Standard apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec91"/>Standard apps</h2></div></div></div><p>Salesforce provides standard apps such as <span class="strong"><strong>Call Center</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Community</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Content</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Marketing</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Sales</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Salesforce Chatter</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Site.com</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Custom apps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec92"/>Custom apps</h2></div></div></div><p>A custom app can optionally include a custom logo.

<span class="strong"><strong>Challenge the requirement to rename Tabs and Labels</strong></span>.</p><p>Consider the benefits of renaming Tabs and labels before doing so.

You can create many different custom field types in Salesforce CRM, including text, number, currency, as well as relationship types that enable lookup, master-detail, and hierarchical relationships.</p><p>Adding custom fields can be carried out by navigating to the field's area of the appropriate object:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For standard objects, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Customize</strong></span>.

Next, click on <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Custom</strong></span> field dependencies and field history tracking</li></ul></div><p>Within the field setup pages, you can set field dependencies and field history tracking for the object. Field history tracking captures information for the date, time, nature of the change, and who made the change. A dependent field is a picklist field for which the valid values depend on the value of another field.</p><p>Whenever history tracking is set, a separate history data object is created for the object. This history data comprises the record ID and the history-tracked field names whose value has been changed. Here, both the old and the new record values are recorded. This is covered later in this chapter in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom field governance</em></span> section.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note122"/>Note</h3><p>Field dependencies and field history tracking are not available for task and event fields, and are described in more detail later in this chapter.</p></div></div><p>Choose a data type for the field to be created. The following screenshot shows the first page (step 1) where a full list of data types (which are described in detail later) are available to choose from:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_03_019.jpg" alt="Creating custom fields"/></div><p>
</p><p>Some data types are only available for certain configurations. For example, the <span class="strong"><strong>Master-Detail Relationship</strong></span> option is available only for custom objects when the custom object does not already have one or more master-detail relationship fields. The <span class="strong"><strong>Roll-Up Summary</strong></span> option is only available for objects defined as Master in master-detail relation and is used to record an aggregate of the child records, using functions such as <code class="literal">SUM</code>, <code class="literal">MAX</code>, and <code class="literal">MIN</code> (these are described in detail later in this chapter).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note123"/>Note</h3><p>Field types not listed in custom field types may appear if your organization installed a package from AppExchange that uses those custom field types.</p></div></div><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> and enter a <span class="strong"><strong>Field Label</strong></span>. <span class="strong"><strong>Field Name</strong></span> is a mandatory field and must be unique within the Salesforce CRM application. There are also some restrictions on what can be entered and what cannot. Here, you can only enter alphanumeric characters and underscores. In addition, the text must start with a letter; it cannot include spaces, it cannot contain two consecutive underscores, and the final character must not be an underscore.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_03_020.jpg" alt="Creating custom fields"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip124"/>Tip</h3><p>Ensure that the custom field name and label are unique and not the same as any existing standard or custom field for that object. Creating identical values may result in unexpected behavior when you reference that name in a merge field. If a standard field and custom field have matching names or labels, the merge field displays the value of the custom field. If two custom fields have matching names or labels, the merge field may not display the value of the field you expect. For example, if you create a field label called <code class="literal">Phone</code>, the field name automatically populates as <code class="literal">Phone__c</code>. If you also have a standard field with the label <code class="literal">Phone</code>, the merge field may not be able to distinguish between the standard and custom field names. Make the custom field name and label unique by adding a suffix to each, such as <code class="literal">Phone_Custom</code> and <code class="literal">Phone_Custom__c</code>, respectively.</p></div></div><p>For relationship fields, choose the object that you want to associate with it:</p><p>

</p><p>Object relationship fields allow you to create a lookup filter that can be used to further control the associated returned records and lookup dialog results for the field.</p><p>These are available for Lookup, Master-detail, and Hierarchical relationship fields. Here, you can select multiple fields and selection criteria to restrict the results. This is presented in an additional step of the field-creation process and is available at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Lookup Filter</strong></span> section, available from step 3.

These referenced fields are known as merge fields. Formula fields are very powerful and flexible mechanisms. However, a formula field cannot be set to reference itself within a formula irrespective of whether the reference is made directly or indirectly.

For example, opportunities can be related by a lookup so an opportunity hierarchy can be shown, or cases have a lookup relationship with contacts that enable you to associate a specific contact with a case.</p><p>A lookup relationship creates a field that allows users to click on a lookup icon which opens up a pop-up window and allows the user to select a record to get the relationship. On the associated record, you can display a related list to show all of the records that are linked to it, and you can create lookup relationship fields that link to the following: users, and custom or standard objects.

<div class="section" title="Lookup relationship options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec47"/>Lookup relationship options</h1></div></div></div><p>When you create a lookup field on an object, you can choose whether the lookup field is required or optional.

However, such a deletion on a lookup relationship is known as a cascade-delete and bypasses security and sharing settings. As a result, users can delete records when the lookup record is deleted even if they do not have access to the related records.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note147"/>Note</h3><p>The cascade-delete feature is disabled by default and is available only by sending a request to Salesforce support.</p></div></div><p>This option is a good choice when the lookup field and its associated record are highly coupled and you need to delete related data whenever the lookup data is removed.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note148"/>Note</h3><p>This option is only available within custom objects and is not available for standard objects.

For non-valid values that are manually entered into the field,  you can set a custom error message which is presented to the user as the record is prevented from saving.</p><p>For fields with optional lookup filters, only values that match the lookup filter criteria appear in the lookup dialog initially. However, users can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Show all results</strong></span> link in the lookup dialog to remove the filter and view all search result values for the lookup field.

Comments must start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk (<code class="literal">/*</code>), and finish with an asterisk followed by a forward slash (<code class="literal">*/</code>).</p><p>Comments are useful for explaining specific parts of a formula to other system administrators viewing the formula definition. Look at the following code block as an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Sales Tax (Percent) =  &#13;
/* value only set for US opportunities */ &#13;
IF( TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US",  &#13;
/* Check for the US State of the Account record and set accordingly */ &#13;
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "California", 0.0925,  &#13;
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,  &#13;
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) ))  &#13;
)  &#13;
, 0) &#13;
</pre><p>Carefully using comments to prevent parts of the formula from being activated allows you to test and verify the syntax as you construct and iron out bugs in the formula. However, if you try to comment out the entire formula as syntax, an error is shown. Also, you will experience a syntax error if you try to place comments within other comments because this is not supported in the Salesforce CRM application:</p><pre class="programlisting">/* /* comment */ */ &#13;
</pre><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note153"/>Note</h3><p>Including comments and formatting with carriage returns and spacing adds to the number of characters used and therefore counts against the character and byte size limits.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Building formula text and compiled character size limits"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec54"/>Building formula text and compiled character size limits</h1></div></div></div><p>There is a text character and byte size limit of 3,900 characters, and a limit of 5,000 characters for the compiled characters for formulas.</p><p>When this limit is reached, you will be unable to save the formula field and will be presented with the following error:</p><pre class="programlisting">Compiled formula is too big to execute (7,085 characters). Maximum size is 5,000 characters. &#13;
</pre><p>It is common to encounter these limits when building complicated formula field calculations and particularly so when building formulas that reference other formula fields. While there is no way to increase this limit, there are some methods to help avoid and workaround these limitations, listed as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use the <code class="literal">CASE</code> function for branch conditions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use algebra</li></ul></div><p>For formulas that use multiple branch conditions to derive the values, as in the preceding example formula, check if the market is <code class="literal">US</code> and the state is <code class="literal">California</code>, <code class="literal">Nevada</code>, or <code class="literal">Utah</code>. You can replace the nested <code class="literal">IF</code> statements and instead use the <code class="literal">CASE</code> statement.</p><p>Nested <code class="literal">IF</code> statements often result in larger compiled sizes where the <code class="literal">IF</code> function is used multiple times, as in our example:</p><pre class="programlisting">IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "California", 0.0925,  &#13;
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,  &#13;
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) ))  &#13;
</pre><p>Using the <code class="literal">CASE</code> statement can provide better logic and often results in a smaller compiled size for the formula:</p><pre class="programlisting">IF( TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US",  &#13;
CASE(Account.State__c, &#13;
"California", 0.0925,  &#13;
""Nevada", 0.0685,  &#13;
"Utah", 0.0475, 0) , &#13;
0) &#13;
</pre><div class="section" title="Using algebra"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec103"/>Using algebra</h2></div></div></div><p>The compiled size of formula fields increases as you increase the number of fields that are referenced. This is compounded when you are referencing fields that are themselves formula fields. A way to reduce the overall size is to use algebra to avoid the need to reference fields, wherever possible. The following example shows how the <code class="literal">Item_Price__c</code> and <code class="literal">Support_Price__c</code> fields are used multiple times:</p><pre class="programlisting">Total Price =  &#13;
(Item_Price__c + (Item_Price__c * Sales_Tax__c)) +  &#13;
(Support_Price__c + (Support_Price__c * Sales_Tax__c)) &#13;
</pre><p>To reduce the compiled size, use simple algebra to avoid multiple uses of the <code class="literal">Item_Price__c</code> and <code class="literal">Support_Price__c</code> fields, as in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Total Price =  &#13;
(Item_Price__c * (1 + Sales_Tax__c)) +  &#13;
(Support_Price__c * (1 + Sales_Tax__c)) &#13;
</pre></div><div class="section" title="Formula field size limit workarounds"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec104"/>Formula field size limit workarounds</h2></div></div></div><p>There may be situations where the logic that is required for a formula is simply too complex for the current size limitations in formula fields. The proven methods to overcome this are to implement a solution using either of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Workflow field updates</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apex trigger updates</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Process Builder field updates</li></ul></div><p>There are two ways in which workflow field updates can help to provide the formula logic workaround. Firstly, larger and more complex formulas can be saved using the formula-building function within the workflow mechanism. Secondly, large formula logic can be decomposed into smaller functions of resulting data. For example, you could create simple formulas that get the data fed from fields that have been updated by multiple workflow field updates.</p><p>Workflows are covered in detail later in this book. However, the general approach for implementing a workflow field update to provide a solution to the formula field limit is to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a non-formula field on the object, such as a currency or number field, in place of the desired formula field. Administrators often identify this field with a suffix to indicate it is a workflow field-for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Total Price (workflow)</strong></span>. This field is then set as read-only on page layouts as the field can be considered a system field (as it should not be available for manual updating).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a workflow rule that will always fire.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a field update with an appropriate formula to update the workflow field-<span class="strong"><strong>Total Price (workflow)</strong></span> in our preceding example.</li></ul></div><p>Any subsequent formulas can reference the populated field. The disadvantages to this workaround are that creating many workflows can add to the complexity of the application and may eventually introduce performance issues. Also, whenever an object has multiple complex workflows assigned, the order in which the workflows are evaluated cannot always be guaranteed, which if not properly maintained can lead to subtle data discrepancies.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Custom field governance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec55"/>Custom field governance</h1></div></div></div><p>Controlling the creation of fields is necessary to avoid adding unnecessary new fields in Salesforce. Without appropriate field creation governance, there is a risk of producing an application with a complex data structure that provides a poor user experience.</p><p>This issue can often be observed due to the ease of creating new custom fields. However, there are other causes such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring spontaneous responses to end-user field creation requests without gathering full requirements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lack of specification or understanding of reporting requirements for field usage</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creation of fields that are too specific for common uses, thus driving the need to create ever more fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lack of knowledge or awareness of existing fields that could be used rather than creating new ones</li></ul></div><p>As the number of unnecessary fields increases, users will find it ever more difficult to enter the correct data into the correct fields. Therefore, the amount of entered data is reduced along with user's satisfaction because the application requires less effort to work with. It is all too easy for your users to become dissatisfied and this can lead to less overall usage and hence poor data quality due to lack of user participation.</p><div class="section" title="Addressing the issue"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec105"/>Addressing the issue</h2></div></div></div><p>Create new fields with care because as each new custom field is added, your application structure increases in complexity. As a system administrator, you are responsible for knowing which fields are used, where they appear on Page Layouts, and which fields are required for reporting.</p><p>If the benefits and long-term use for a new field cannot be easily understood, it is unlikely to be of much use. One method to help determine its use is to consider where and how the proposed new field would be used. If it is never going to be reported, it may be worth querying its purpose and value. The following considerations can be made when creating new fields.</p><div class="section" title="More generic field names"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec105"/>More generic field names</h3></div></div></div><p>Try to make your field names more generic so that they can serve multiple purposes. In some situations, different business units share objects but track different information. Although they may have different requirements, they can often share fields. Here you need to be proactive, forward-thinking, and reach out to the business and propose fields that can be used across multiple business units.</p></div><div class="section" title="Field history tracking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec106"/>Field history tracking</h3></div></div></div><p>Often there are unnecessary date fields that are used to track milestones or data-processing dates. With native field history tracking, these milestones can be tracked and reported without the need to always create new fields.</p><p>Field history tracking can be applied on certain custom and standard fields for custom objects and the following core standard objects: <span class="strong"><strong>Accounts</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Cases</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Contacts</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Contracts</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Leads</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Opportunities</strong></span> using the <span class="strong"><strong>Set History Tracking</strong></span> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_03_027.jpg" alt="Field history tracking"/></div><p>
</p><p>Upon clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Set History Tracking</strong></span> button, a page appears, displaying the activation of field history tracking and selection of the fields to be tracked, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_03_028.jpg" alt="Field history tracking"/></div><p>
</p><p>Changes to fields that have been set up for field history tracking will see a new entry to the object's history-related list whenever changes are made to records (where that field is modified). All entries include the date, time, details of the change, and the name of the user that made the change as shown here.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note154"/>Note</h3><p>Not all field types can have their history tracked. Changes to field types greater than 255 characters are tracked as edited; their old and new values are not recorded.</p></div></div><p>There is a maximum of 20 fields per object that can be set to be tracked.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note155"/>Note</h3><p>Field history data does not count against your organization's storage limit, however, at the time of publication, <a class="ulink" href="http://Salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> are planning to move toward a policy of deleting field history data that is older than 18 months. Here, they recommend establishing your own field history retention policy such as extracting the data from the system.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Custom objects to store dated information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec107"/>Custom objects to store dated information</h3></div></div></div><p>You can create custom objects to store dated information and related lists to avoid hard-coding date fields on a record. For example, avoid creating fields to track dated historical financial information within an object. Here, you may have to create redundant fields for each year. For example, 2011 Budgets, 2012 Budgets, and so on. Instead, create a <code class="literal">Financials</code> object with one set of fields and a corresponding date field where you can create a new record each year. This can result in fewer fields and far better display and reporting.</p></div><div class="section" title="Chatter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec108"/>Chatter</h3></div></div></div><p>Consider the use of <span class="strong"><strong>Chatter</strong></span> to eliminate unnecessary fields. Often, text-area boxes are used to track conversation flows such as support comments and internal review. These text messages can often be better facilitated with the use of <span class="strong"><strong>Chatter</strong></span> posts. <span class="strong"><strong>Chatter</strong></span> is covered later in

They are used to establish unique layouts for different business scenarios.</p><p>The displayed fields within a related list are controlled by the page layout; the name of the related list is determined by the lookup/master-detail relationship on the related object.</p><p>Page layouts are comprised of sections containing the buttons, fields, related lists, and customer links which can be edited using the enhanced page layout editor as shown in the following screenshot.

<div class="section" title="Record types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec58"/>Record types</h1></div></div></div><p>Record types are a feature of Salesforce CRM that allow you to provide different sets of object picklists, different page layouts, and custom business processes to specific users, based on their profile or assigned permission set. Record types can be used in various ways, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create record types for opportunities to differentiate your internal sales deals from your field sales deals and show different fields and picklist values</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create record types for leads to display different page layouts for your tele-sales leads versus your internal sales prospecting functions</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Creating a record type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec109"/>Creating a record type</h2></div></div></div><p>The record type,  <code class="literal">Master</code> , is always set for every object and contains all the picklist and process options. It is not, however, listed under the record types list and it can be assigned as a record type for a profile, provided it is the only assigned as a record type for that profile.</p><p>Since each record type is assigned to one page-layout type per profile, the numbers of page assignments can easily increase. This means that if you have two custom record types for an account and five profiles, you will have 15 page assignments (5*2 for each custom record type, and five for the <code class="literal">Master</code> record type).</p><p>Selectable record types are assigned per profile and field-level security is configured separately for each record type. Consider the following when creating a record type:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Which record types are associated with the current profile?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If more than one record type is associated with the current profile, prompt the user for record-type selection</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If only one, select that record type without prompting (this would be set as default)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Based upon record type and profile, assign the appropriate page layout</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Based upon record type, assign the appropriate process and picklist values</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By associating different record types to different page layouts, fields, and picklist values, you can formulate a set of object-specific processes. In Salesforce CRM, the following are available:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Lead</code> process using the <code class="literal">Lead</code> object, which is governed by the <code class="literal">Status</code> field (which is configured to be <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Closed</strong></span>, and so on)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Sales</code> process, which uses the <code class="literal">Opportunity</code> object and the <code class="literal">Stage</code> field (set to be <span class="strong"><strong>WON</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>LOST</strong></span>, and so on), plus the <code class="literal">Amount</code> and <code class="literal">Probability</code> fields</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Support</code> process, which uses the <code class="literal">Case</code> object and is controlled by the <code class="literal">CaseStatus</code> field (which may be set to <span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Closed</strong></span>, and so on)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">Solutions</code> process, which uses the <code class="literal">Solution</code> object and the fields <code class="literal">Status</code> (which are set to be <span class="strong"><strong>Draft</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Deployed</strong></span>, and so on)</li></ul></div><p>
</p></li></ul></div><p>For example, your sales team creates an opportunity that represents a sales deal. Your sales support team then upsells on this deal. You can then create two sales processes with two different record types and two different page layouts: <span class="strong"><strong>Sales and Support</strong></span>.</p><p>You would want to create a lookup relationship from opportunity to opportunity, and only require or display this relationship for the support team profile.</p><p>You would also be able to configure the sharing rules so that they could not modify each other's opportunities.
