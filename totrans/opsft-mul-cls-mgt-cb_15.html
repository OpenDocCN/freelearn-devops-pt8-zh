			<p><em class="italic">Learning never exhausts the mind.</em></p>
			<p>– <em class="italic">Leonardo da Vinci</em></p>
			<p>The last chapter! When we were writing this book, we were wondering what a good last chapter for it would be. We strongly believe that learning never ends! That being said, we came to the conclusion that a good last chapter would be related to some suggestions about training and the next steps you could take to keep learning and deepening your knowledge even further—we hope you enjoy the options we introduce here.</p>
			<p>In particular, we’ll look at the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Red Hat training</li>
				<li>Online learning platforms</li>
				<li>Free training and references</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Red Hat training</h1>
			<p>It is evident the <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/>benefits that any organization gets from training and enablement. In a nutshell, training is capable of increasing productivity, reducing waste, standardizing processes, and boosting inner motivation. <strong class="bold">International Data Corporation</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDC</strong>) research from 2020 in five different countries and companies with more than 11,000 employees on average found the following benefits from taking training provided by Red Hat:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Development-operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>) teams experienced 44% higher productivity.</li>
				<li>34% more efficient <strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) infrastructure teams compared to those that had not taken the training.</li>
				<li>Teams deploy new IT resources 59% faster.</li>
				<li>New employees achieve full productivity 76% faster.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, there is a large set of different training and resources available on the market, for <em class="italic">every pocket</em>! For this<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> reason, we brought here some suggestions about where to look for enablement and educate you and your team on OpenShift. Combine the references you find in this chapter with the personas you saw in <a href="B18015_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">OpenShift Personas and Skillset</em>, and you will likely have a successful and great OpenShift adoption!</p>
			<p>You will find the following in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A list of suggested training resources</li>
				<li>References on the internet where you can look for documentation, tutorials, and posts about OpenShift</li>
				<li>A list of certifications that will help you and your team to establish as experts with OpenShift</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Training and certifications</h2>
			<p>This book is<a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/> intended to be a comprehensive reference for OpenShift, and we covered some important topics around architecture, deployment, operations, and multi-cluster tools. However, we can confidently say that OpenShift is a world of different cultures! As such, although this book will help you in your journey, we strongly recommend that you also educate yourself through training. In this section, you will find some skill paths we suggest for professionals that want to go even deeper with their OpenShift knowledge.</p>
			<h3>Skills paths</h3>
			<p>We bring to you<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/> here three<a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/> different suggested skills paths:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps transformation</strong>: For DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>and <strong class="bold">site reliability engineering</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>) engineers<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/> that are looking into working with DevOps and Agile practices and tools on top of OpenShift. As we have seen in <a href="B18015_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">OpenShift Personas and Skillset</em>, this role usually works with automation and processes, so in this skills path, you will find courses that address people, processes, and technology related to DevOps.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/> is a path for those who want to have <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>more in-depth information about Kubernetes itself. As OpenShift runs on top of Kubernetes, the training covered in this path is also valuable for OpenShift; however, it is agnostic and not focused on any distribution of Kubernetes, such as OpenShift and others.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">OpenShift</strong>: Training <a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/>that covers both sides of OpenShift<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> usage, development, and administration. In this section, you will see a list of training and certifications suggested for each profile.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Check out the following sections for more information on each skill path.</p>
			<h3>DevOps transformation</h3>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> section, we suggest training that will take you<a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/> through aspects related to people, processes, and technology.</p>
			<h4>DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement</h4>
			<p>We know<a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/> that DevOps has been adopted for quite some time and almost everywhere; however, from our personal experience, there are several companies that unfortunately don’t realize the benefits of its adoption. This is mostly due to the cultural change that these companies often forget to implement: cultural shift is the most challenging thing about DevOps—by far, from our perspective. If you feel that you and your team need a cultural refreshment, this course is for you. It follows a practical approach with 5-day immersive training that we recommend you take with your teammates <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>to experience near-real-world delivery using agile methodologies and DevOps practices. Here’s a course overview:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer368" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18015_15_Table_001.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h4>Open Practices for your DevOps Journey</h4>
			<p>While the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> training is focused on culture, this one is focused on processes. It takes students through the discovery, planning, and delivery of projects driven by DevOps practices. Here’s an overview of the course:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer369" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18015_15_Table_002.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h4>Red Hat DevOps Pipelines and Processes: CI/CD with Jenkins, Git, and Test Driven Development</h4>
			<p>To close the loop <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/>of people (culture), processes, and technology, this training will build technical skills for DevOps teams<a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/> around <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) technologies using Git, Jenkins, and <strong class="bold">test-driven development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>). It is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>practical training course that uses sample applications to learn how to use the technologies listed. Have a look at an<a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/> overview of the course here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer370" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18015_15_Table_003.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Kubernetes</h3>
			<p>You will <a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/>easily find a huge collection of training courses about<a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/> Kubernetes on the market, paid and free ones. We outlined here some good references so that you can go deeper into Kubernetes itself.</p>
			<h4>Kubernetes Basics</h4>
			<p>The first we <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>want to indicate is a tutorial from the official <strong class="source-inline">kubernetes.io</strong> portal. In <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>this tutorial, you will be guided through some basic lessons such as Kubernetes cluster creating using <strong class="source-inline">minikube</strong>, application deployment, scaling, and updates. It uses interactive environments so that you can exercise the lessons step by step interactively with a practical approach. Here’s an overview of the course:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer371" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18015_15_Table_004.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Another great <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>practical reference is a project named <em class="italic">Kube by Example</em>, which we will give more details about next.</p>
			<h4>Kube by Example</h4>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/> project contains several practical examples to help you learn more about Kubernetes. You have access to lessons about basic concepts such as what is a pod, deployment, service, namespace, and so on, but also learning paths related to application development and more. Have a look at an overview of the course here:</p>

We really hope you now feel more prepared and confident about working with OpenShift in the cloud, on-premises, and even both—from one cluster to many! Thanks for being our partner during the course of this book, and we look forward to meeting you anytime soon!</p>
			<p>Our sincere message of thanks and, as we said, learning is constant and the sources of information are many. To achieve your goals without getting lost or straying along the path of so many opportunities, we leave some tips here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Look at the technology options available today.</li>
				<li>Research those that have seen the most adoption and absorption in terms of ease of use, learning, and documentation, as well as employment and career opportunities.</li>
				<li>Choose the way forward and stay focused.</li>
				<li>Emerging technologies can be a good path, but they are often risky. If you want to adopt new technologies, don’t forget to take into account the path and plan you created, as this will help you to continue understanding where you are and where you want to go.</li>
				<li>Write down your findings—they will surely help you very soon.</li>
				<li>During your studies, set aside leisure time with family and friends.</li>
				<li>Exercise regularly—a healthy mind also comes from a healthy body.</li>
			</ul>
