- en: Configuration management has become a requirement for system administrators.
    Knowing how to use configuration management tools, such as Puppet, enables administrators
    to take full advantage of automated provisioning systems and cloud resources.
    There is a natural progression from performing a task, scripting a task to creating
    a module in Puppet, or Puppetizing a task.

- en: This book takes you beyond the basics and explores the full power of Puppet,
    showing you in detail how to tackle a variety of real-world problems and applications.
    At every step, it shows you exactly what commands you need to type and includes
    complete code samples for every recipe. It takes you from a rudimentary knowledge
    of Puppet to a more complete and expert understanding of Puppet's latest and most
    advanced features, community best practices, scaling, and performance. This edition
    of the book includes recipes for configuring and using Hiera, puppetdb and operating
    a centralized puppetmaster configuration.

- en: This book also includes real examples from production systems and techniques
    that are in use in some of the world's largest Puppet installations. It will show
    you different ways to do things using Puppet, and point out some of the pros and
    cons of these approaches.

    without having to work your way through from cover to cover. Whatever your level
    of Puppet experience, there's something for you—from simple workflow tips to advanced,
    high-performance Puppet architectures.

    tools that I feel are important today, such as r10k. The #puppet IRC channel,
    puppetlabs blog ([http://puppetlabs.com/blog](http://puppetlabs.com/blog)), and
    the Forge ([http://forge.puppetlabs.com](http://forge.puppetlabs.com)) are great
    resources to stay up to date with the changes being made to Puppet.'

    and Style*, introduces the Puppet language and shows how to write manifests. The
    Puppet linting tool, puppet-lint, is introduced and we review best practices to
    write Puppet code. Metaparameters are shown with examples. We also preview proposed
    changes to the Puppet language by using the future parser.'

    is all about how to deploy Puppet in your environment. We cover the two main methods
    of installation, centralized and decentralized (masterless). We show you how to
    use Git to centrally manage your code. We also configure puppetdb and Hiera.'

    Manifests*, deals with organizing your Puppet manifests. Manifests are used to
    build modules; we introduce the concept of roles and profiles to abstract how
    modules are applied to machines. Parameterized classes are introduced. We also
    show you how to efficiently define resources with arrays of resources and resource
    defaults.'

    with Files and Packages*, shows you how to manage files using snippets (fragments).
    We introduce the power of templating with both Ruby (ERB) and Puppet (EPP) templates.
    We also explore ways to secure information stored in your Puppet manifests.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Users and Virtual Resources"), *Users and
    Virtual Resources*, deals with the advanced topic of virtual and exported resources.
    Virtual resources are a way of defining resources but not applying them by default.
    Exported resources are similar but are used to have resources from one machine,
    applied to one or more other machines.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Managing Resources and Files"), *Managing
    Resources and Files*, is about dealing with directories and purging resources
    not controlled by Puppet. We show you how to have file resources applied differently
    on different machines. Methods for managing host entries in `/etc/hosts` are shown
    with exported resources examples.'
