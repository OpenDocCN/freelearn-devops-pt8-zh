<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">You can think of the public cloud as an electric power supply model, where you switch on the light and pay only for the amount of electricity you use in units. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">You stop paying for it from the moment you switch it off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">It abstracts you from the complexity of power generation using turbines, resources to maintain the facility, and a significant infrastructure setup, and you use the entire service in a simplified way.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">In addition to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker212"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">cost benefits, major public cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and Oracle Cloud Platform (OCP), help to bring innovation by extending their technology platforms through the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">These public cloud providers have mastered scalability and future-looking architecture with comprehensive machine learning and analytics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">With the public cloud, you get access to these cutting-edge technologies and the option of using them to advance your architecture.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">A </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">private cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">, or </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">on-premises cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">, is registered </span><a id="_idIndexMarker213"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">to a single organization that owns and accesses it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Private clouds </span><a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">act as a replication or extension of the company’s existing data center. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">In comparison, a public cloud has a shared tenancy, which means virtual servers from multiple customers share the same physical server; however, they offer dedicated physical servers if the customer wants them for a license or compliance need.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">The third </span><a id="_idIndexMarker215"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">model is a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">hybrid cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">, used by large enterprises who are moving their workload from on-premises to a cloud, where they still have a legacy application that cannot move to the cloud directly or maybe they have a licensed application that needs to stay on-premises—or sometimes, due to compliance reasons, they need to secure data on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">In such a situation, the hybrid model helps when the enterprise has to maintain a partial environment on-premises and move other applications to the public cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">Sometimes, an organization moves to test and develop the environment to the public cloud and keep production environments on-premises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">A hybrid model can vary depending on the organization’s cloud strategy.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">As multiple public cloud providers are in the market, you may start seeing </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">multi-cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> trends, where enterprises choose to distribute their workload between different public cloud vendors to get the most out of each cloud technology or provide options to their team depending on their skill set.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Let’s understand more about the public cloud and how it is becoming an essential technology platform for businesses.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Solution architecture in the cloud has become increasingly important and is becoming the “new normal” as more enterprises choose to migrate their workload to it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">The public cloud has been </span><a id="_idIndexMarker216"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">a critical factor fueling start-up organizations’ growth, as they only need a small upfront investment rather than investing upfront in costly on-premises solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">It allows organizations to be run as an experiment, and to be agile and innovative.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">The great thing about cloud computing architecture is that you have an end-to-end view of all architecture components, including the frontend platforms, the application development platform, servers, storage, database, automation, delivery, and the networks that are required to manage the entire solution landscape.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Let’s learn more about the public cloud architecture.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-83"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Public cloud architecture</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">A typical definition of the public cloud is a fully virtualized environment accessible over the internet and through a private network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">However, public cloud vendors have recently started </span><a id="_idIndexMarker217"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">offering an on-premises physical infrastructure for better hybrid cloud adoption. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">The public cloud provides a multi-tenancy model, where IT infrastructure, such as storage and computational power, is shared between multiple customers; however, it is isolated at the software and logical network levels and does not interfere with each other’s workloads. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">Organizations can create network-level isolation in the public cloud to have their virtual private cloud equivalent to the logical data center. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.4">Looking at organizations’ regulatory needs, the public cloud also provides dedicated physical instances; however, those are also accessible over the web, but this is a less common option.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Public cloud storage achieves high durability and availability by creating a redundancy model using multiple data centers and robust data replication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">This makes it achieve architecture resiliency and easy scalability. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">There are three major types of public cloud computing models, as shown in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Figure 3.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">On-premises solutions are also shown for comparison purposes.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">As the public cloud functionality and the cost model are very different, let’s learn how to develop a cloud-native approach to architecture design.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-85"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Cloud-native architecture</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">With increasing cloud adoption, cloud-native (or cloud-based) architecture optimizes system architectures for cloud capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">A typical on-premises architecture is usually built for fixed </span><a id="_idIndexMarker227"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">infrastructure, as adding new IT resources such as servers and computing power can add a considerable amount of time, cost, and effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">However, the cloud is charged based on usage and provides ease through automation, such as scaling servers up and down, on demand, without worrying about a long procurement cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.3">Cloud-native architecture focuses on achieving on-demand scale, distributed design, and replacing failed components rather than fixing them.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">In cloud-native architecture, you continually create automated operations for recovery, scalability, self-healing, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker228"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">high availability using the cloud capabilities of </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">continuous integration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">CI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">), deployment, and infrastructure automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">It encourages the continuous optimization of your application in terms of cost and performance, using new cloud capabilities that are released and improved upon every day.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Public cloud providers allow global infrastructure to spread across the world, which helps an application to be scaled globally near your user base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.2">To encourage adoption, all cloud services provide a free-tier service with lots of learning resources, so you can try your hand and develop your knowledge of them.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">The refactor method involves rearchitecting and rewriting an application before migrating it to the cloud to make it a cloud-native application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">In refactoring, you change the application </span><a id="_idIndexMarker249"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">to a more modular design, such as from monolithic to microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Refactoring to microservices helps organizations create small independent teams that can take complete ownership, thus increasing the speed of innovation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">Cloud-native applications are applications that have been designed, architected, and built to perform efficiently in a cloud environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.2">The benefits of these cloud-inherent capabilities include </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">scalability</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">security</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">agility</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">cost-efficiency</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">Refactoring requires more time and resources before migration to recode the application and architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">This approach is commonly used by organizations with extensive cloud experience or a highly skilled workforce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">An alternative option for refactoring is to migrate your application to the cloud and then optimize it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.4">You can use cloud-native serverless technologies to reduce the admin overhead of a modular design.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">Deciding whether to rearchitect an application to microservices or rebuild it for containerization or serverless architecture requires careful consideration of the organization’s strategic goals, cost implications, and technical capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">Rearchitecting to microservices offers enhanced scalability and flexibility, allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, which can significantly benefit long-term agility and efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.3">However, this approach might involve substantial refactoring and could introduce complexity in terms of service coordination and network communication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.4">On the other hand, rebuilding the architecture to adopt containerization or serverless models can streamline operations, reduce infrastructure overhead, and improve deployment speed, albeit with an initial investment in development and a potential learning curve for the team.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">The decision should factor in the application’s compatibility with the new architecture, the expertise of the team, and the potential impact on performance and reliability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">While microservices can improve fault isolation and facilitate more granular resource management, containerization and serverless architectures can optimize resource use and potentially </span><a id="_idIndexMarker250"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">reduce costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Security and compliance are also critical considerations, as each architectural style introduces unique challenges that must be proactively addressed.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">Sometimes, a significant effort is made to rebuild an application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">As an architect, you should evaluate </span><a id="_idIndexMarker251"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">whether purchasing a SaaS product helps you get a better </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">return on investment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">ROI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">Let’s explore the repurchase strategy in more detail.</span></p>

<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-105"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">Data migration</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">Cloud data migration refers to moving existing data to a new cloud storage location. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.2">Most </span><a id="_idIndexMarker293"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">applications will require data storage </span><a id="_idIndexMarker294"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">throughout their progression into the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.2">Storage migration typically aligns with one of two approaches, but organizations may perform both at the same time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">First, a single lift and shift move. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.2">This may be required before new applications can be started in the cloud.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">Second, a hybrid model weighted toward the cloud, which results in newly architected cloud-native projects with some legacy on-premises data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.2">The legacy data stores may shift toward the cloud over time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">However, your approach to migrating data will vary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.2">It depends on factors such as the amount of data, network and bandwidth constraints, the data classification tier (such as backup data, mission-critical data, data warehouses, or archive data), the level of data security, and the amount of time you can allocate for the migration process.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">Suppose you have extensive archives of data or data lakes in a situation where bandwidth and data volumes are unrealistic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.2">In that case, you should lift and shift the data from its current location straight into a cloud provider’s data center. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.3">You can do this by using dedicated network connections to accelerate network transfers or by physically transferring the data over the hard drive.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">If your data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker295"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">stores can gradually migrate over time or when new data is aggregating from many non-cloud sources, consider methods that provide a friendly interface to the cloud storage service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.2">These migration services can leverage or complement existing installations, such as backup and recovery </span><a id="_idIndexMarker296"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">software or a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">storage area network</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">SAN</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">).</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">For a small-scale database, one-step migration is the best option, which requires you to shut down </span><a id="_idIndexMarker297"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">the application for a couple of hours to a few days as per the complexity of the workload. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.2">During the downtime, all information from the database is extracted and migrated to the destination database in the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.3">Once the database has been migrated, it must be validated with the source database for no data loss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.4">After that, a final cutover can be completed.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">In the opposite case, if a system requires minimal downtime, a two-step migration process is more commonly used for databases of any size:</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">In the entire process, there is no downtime. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.2">After completing the migration task, you can perform functionality and performance tests for connectivity to external applications or any other criteria as needed.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">During this time, as the source database is still up and running, changes will need to be propagated or replicated before the final cutover. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">At this point, you would schedule downtime for the database, usually a few hours, and synchronize the source and destination databases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.3">After all the change data has been transferred to the target database, you should perform data validation to ensure a successful migration and route application traffic to a new cloud database.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">You might have mission-critical databases that cannot have any downtime. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.2">Performing such zero-downtime migrations requires detailed planning and the appropriate data replication tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.3">You will need to use continuous data replication tools for such scenarios, such as AWS DataSync, Oracle GoldenGate, or NetApp SnapMirror. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.4">It is important to note here that source database latency can be impacted in the case of synchronous </span><a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">replication as it waits for data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker300"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">to be replicated everywhere before responding to the application while the replication is happening.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">You can use asynchronous replication if your database downtime lasts only a few minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">With zero-downtime migration, you have more flexibility regarding when to perform the cutover since the source and target databases are always in sync.</span></p>
