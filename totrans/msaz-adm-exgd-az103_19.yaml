    It offers traditional username and password identity management, and roles and
    permissions management. On top of that, it offers more enterprise-grade solutions,
    such as **Multi-Factor Authentication** (**MFA**) and application monitoring,
    solution monitoring, and alerting. Azure AD can easily be integrated with your
    on-premises Active Directory to create a hybrid infrastructure.
