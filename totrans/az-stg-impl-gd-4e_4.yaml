    and resiliency, and scale on demand. One of the key motivations for organizations
    to migrate to Azure is to reduce the **total cost of ownership** (**TCO**) for
    their IT infrastructure. By migrating to Azure, organizations can move from a
    **capital expenditure** (**CapEx**) model with fixed upfront commitments to a
    more flexible and scalable **operational expenditure** (**OpEx**) model. With
    the OpEx model, organizations reduce spending by only paying for resources and
    services that they consume.

    will gain by migrating to Azure. First, we'll see that Microsoft provides a framework
    that will guide you in architecting for reliability, security, and high availability.
    We will then explore the underlying infrastructure of Azure to help you make the
    most informed choice to meet your migration goals. After we have built our foundational
    knowledge in Azure infrastructure, we will discuss some of the common workload
    migration scenarios and how you can achieve cloud scale and maximize performance.

    and applications were impacted. While some organizations were able to migrate
    their applications to the cloud, others had to redesign their environment in the
    cloud. However, designing and deploying a successful workload in the cloud can
    be challenging, especially when there is a time constraint for an organization
    to ensure that they continue to support their clients around the world.

    that differ from operating on-premises, such as the way you manage workloads,
    infrastructure costs, monitoring, security, and performance. Many of the management
    tasks that we used to do for on-premises applications do not apply to the cloud.

    a doubt, virtualization has positively streamlined how organizations are deploying
    and managing their IT infrastructure on Azure, thanks in part to solutions such

    Azure. It automatically implements VM management best practices as defined in
    the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework. Azure Automanage eliminates the need for
    service discovery, enrollment, and configuration of VMs. For example, Azure Automanage
    enables customers to implement security best practices by offering an easy way
    to apply an operating system baseline to VMs per Microsoft's baseline configuration.
    Services such as Azure Security Center are automatically onboarded per the configuration
    profile chosen by the customer. If the VM's configuration drifts from the applied
    best practices, Azure Automanage detects and automatically brings the VM back
    to the desired configuration.

    database software, and backups. You should choose the appropriate Azure database

    You can use autoscaling with many Azure services, such as Azure **Virtual Machine

    might experience a short-term increase in traffic. Such spikes can happen at any
    time, which makes it difficult to plan for potential spikes in traffic. This unpredictability
    of events means manual scaling is not an option and it would be prohibitively
    expensive to keep your website resources available at all times in case of a sudden
    spike. This is where Azure autoscaling comes in handy. It will automatically scale
    up or down your resources according to your configured autoscale rules, giving

    geo-redundant storage** (**RA-GRS**), or **zone-redundant storage** (**ZRS**).
    Azure Backup improves security, as it has encryption capabilities to secure data

    and resilient to planned or unplanned outages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    running during planned or unplanned outages. ASR has the capacity to replicate
    workloads that are running on-premises or on VMs and restore them in a different
    location. This way, if an outage occurs at your primary location, you will have
    the ability to replicate your workloads to a secondary location and be able to
    ensure business continuity. Once your primary location is up and running, you
    can then perform a failback to it.'
  prefs: []

    costs by eliminating the need for building or maintaining a costly secondary datacenter.
    Plus, you only pay for compute resources when VMs are spun up, meaning at the
    time of actual failover.
