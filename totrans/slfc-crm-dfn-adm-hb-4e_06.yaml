    that help manage the quality and integrity of data. The previous chapter also

    Salesforce CRM.

- en: These analytics tools allow you and your users to customize and manage the reporting
    and visual representation of data. For example, the sales team can produce reports
    that show the sales pipeline, the marketing team can report on the progress of
    campaigns, and you can create reports that display the number of active users
    in your Salesforce organization. The features available to report data are described
    in detail, including details on how to create, customize, and export purpose-built
    report data. Reports can also be used to improve the quality of data. You can,
    for example, create a report that lists all accounts with missing annual revenue
    fields.

    are automatically provided when your organization is first set up by Salesforce.
    These predefined reports are known as standard reports and are located in pre-prepared
    report folders known as standard report folders. For example, standard reports
    provide information about accounts and contacts; details about opportunities,
    forecasts, products, and sales pipelines; information about your organizations
    leads; details about forecast reports for customizable forecasting, and so on.

    field to describe exactly what the report is intended for (there is an upper limit
    of 255 characters). Consider creating reports that are only needed for dashboards
    in separate report folders, called something like Dashboard Reports Sales, for
    example. Perform regular spring cleans where you delete unwanted reports. You
    can also create temporary reports that are hidden from all users and save these

    Conditional highlighting, dashboard components, and dynamic dashboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answer 1 - Report formats
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is **d**) Reports generated using the Tabular Report Format are the
    easiest and quickest way to report data and are most suited for creating lists
    of records.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answer 2 - Groupings
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is **c**) Summary. Although **b**) Joined and d) Matrix can also
    be used to create grouped reports, the most suitable (and simplest) report type
    is Summary. Option **a**) Tabular does not allow the grouping of report data fields.

- en: Answer 3 - Conditional Highlighting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is **b**) Summary, and **c**) Matrix. Conditional Highlighting is
    used in reports that contain at least one summary field, so Tabular reports cannot
    be used. Although Joined reports can have grouping, they cannot have Conditional
    Highlighting.
