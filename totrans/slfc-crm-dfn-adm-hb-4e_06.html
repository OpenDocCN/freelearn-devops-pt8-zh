The previous chapter also outlined the features and tools that are available for importing and exporting data to and from Salesforce CRM.</p><p>In this chapter, We will continue to look at the subject of data, but from the viewpoint of reporting, We will describe the analytics building blocks within Salesforce CRM.</p><p>These analytics tools allow you and your users to customize and manage the reporting and visual representation of data. For example, the sales team can produce reports that show the sales pipeline, the marketing team can report on the progress of campaigns, and you can create reports that display the number of active users in your Salesforce organization. The features available to report data are described in detail, including details on how to create, customize, and export purpose-built report data. Reports can also be used to improve the quality of data. You can, for example, create a report that lists all accounts with missing annual revenue fields.</p><p>We will also look in detail at how these analytical elements can be used to provide sophisticated dashboard charting and graphics.</p><p>Salesforce CRM analytics consist of the basic mechanisms of reports, dashboards, and folders:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span>: Reports are the key building blocks for analytics in Salesforce CRM, where a resulting set of records are displayed in rows and columns to match the specified criteria. Report results may be further filtered and grouped, and may also be displayed as graphical summaries.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Dashboards</strong></span>: Dashboards are visual Components generated from data in reports. These Components can include the following five types: charts, gauges, tables, metrics, and Visualforce pages.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Folders</strong></span>: Folders are used to store the reports and dashboards and can be set to either read-only or read/write. To configure which of your users have access to a folder, you can set it to be accessible by all users, hidden from all users, or accessible only by certain users. When restricting to certain users, options exist to restrict by Public Groups, Roles, and Roles and Subordinates.</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Reports"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec81"/>Reports</h1></div></div></div><p>Within Salesforce CRM, reports are accessed from the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> tab (as shown in the following screenshot). There is a large variety of predefined reports that are automatically provided when your organization is first set up by Salesforce. These predefined reports are known as standard reports and are located in pre-prepared report folders known as standard report folders. For example, standard reports provide information about accounts and contacts; details about opportunities, forecasts, products, and sales pipelines; information about your organizations leads; details about forecast reports for customizable forecasting, and so on.</p><p>In this section on reports, we will outline the available standard reports and describe some of the key reports for system administrators in particular.</p><p>The predefined reports are suitable for existing objects and fields. They would not  be suitable for reporting on any new objects that you have created. For this, we will look at how to extend the existing reports and how to create completely new types of reports, which are known as custom report types in Salesforce CRM.</p><p>Texisting objects and fields. They would are not be suitable for reporting on any new objects that you have created. For this, we will look at how to extend the existing reports and how to create completely new types of reports, known in Salesforce CRM as custom report types.</p><p>When building reports from either standard or custom report types, Salesforce provides a full-featured drag-and-drop editor to simplify the setup and layout of reports.</p><p>We will first look at how to use report folders, which can help organize and control users access to reports within Salesforce CRM. When we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> tab, the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports and Dashboards</strong></span> home page presents the following features:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">This represents the <span class="strong"><strong>New Report</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>New Dashboard</strong></span> buttons.</li><li class="listitem">This represents the <span class="strong"><strong>Folders</strong></span> search box, which allows users to search for specific report and dashboard folders.</li><li class="listitem">This represents the <span class="strong"><strong>New Report Folder</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Create New Dashboard Folder</strong></span> selections.</li><li class="listitem">This represents the <span class="strong"><strong>Report</strong></span> search box, which allows users to search for specific reports and dashboards.</li><li class="listitem">This represents the<span class="strong"><strong> Reports and Dashboards Folder </strong></span>pane with different icons to show whether the folder is a report or a dashboard.</li><li class="listitem">This represents the<span class="strong"><strong> Main Reports and Dashboards List V</strong></span>iew section.

This can be done by clicking to the right of the folder name and selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>Pin to top</strong></span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_06_003-1.jpg" alt="Keep favorite report folders in view"/></div><p>
</p><p>Unlike many IT systems, creating reports in Salesforce CRM is very simple; users can create reports themselves. Since it is so easy for users to create reports, without careful control and an organized approach to report creation, it is easy for the number of reports to rapidly increase and become difficult to manage. You should, for example, create report folders that only certain users have access to. This could be restricted to certain departments or geographical regions. For example, reports could be restricted to Global Marketing or to the North American Sales Team.</p><p>To create new report folders, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>New Report Folder</strong></span> option, where the <span class="strong"><strong>New ReportFolder</strong></span> page is presented, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_06_004-1.jpg" alt="Keep favorite report folders in view"/></div><p>
</p><p>Here, you provide the name of the report folder and decide whether the public folder access is set to be read-only or read/write. You can optionally move reports from the Unfiled <code class="literal">Public Reports</code> folder. You must specify the accessibility to users. You can select either the accessible by all users, hidden from all users, or accessible by certain users options. These options are available in the following: <span class="strong"><strong>Public Groups</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Roles</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Roles and Subordinates</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note211"/>Note</h3><p>Only users with the <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Public Reports</strong></span> user permission are able to delete reports from the report folders.

<span class="strong"><strong>Report name on two lines:</strong></span></p><p>It is possible to format the report name to be split onto two lines to help make it easier to show the name. This can be done by entering the colon (:) character. Simply enter the report name with a colon character, for example, A01 North America: April Sales and the report name will be shown on two lines when viewing the report.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Caution: this is a non-documented feature so may not be supported by Salesforce.</strong></span>
</p></div></div><p>Selecting the appropriate report type is one of the most important steps in creating a report. Report types set the rules for which records can be shown in reports. They allow predefined sets of records and fields to be available within a report based on the relationship between a primary object and any related objects.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip214"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Best practices for reports:</strong></span></p><p>Establish a report naming convention, for example, A01 NA April Sales, B02 INT April Sales, and so on, as this can make it easier to refer to reports using the coding scheme (there is an upper limit of 40 characters). Use the Description field to describe exactly what the report is intended for (there is an upper limit of 255 characters). Consider creating reports that are only needed for dashboards in separate report folders, called something like Dashboard Reports Sales, for example. Perform regular spring cleans where you delete unwanted reports. You can also create temporary reports that are hidden from all users and save these reports there while you figure out if they are required.</p></div></div><p>In the Salesforce CRM application, there are standard report types, and you, as system administrator, can set up custom report types.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note215"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Terminology check:</strong></span></p><p>Custom Report Type is different from Custom Report in Salesforce CRM. When users create a new report using the <span class="strong"><strong>New Report</strong></span> button on the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> home page, this is sometimes known as a custom report. Custom Report Type is a report template that only system administrators can create. It provides a custom set of associated objects and fields to produce predefined report templates from which any users custom report can be created.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Standard report types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec163"/>Standard report types</h3></div></div></div><p>Salesforce provides a large range of predefined standard report types along with standard report folders accessible from the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> tab, as shown in the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

<span class="strong"><strong>Conditional highlighting</strong></span> is a very powerful way to show, at a glance, whether the values in reports are within acceptable limits. By setting up <span class="strong"><strong>Conditional highlighting</strong></span>, you can specify different colors for different ranges of values in your reports. It is relatively easy to set up and it offers great visual benefits, and yet it is a feature that seems to be underused by users within Salesforce CRM.</p><p>To enable <span class="strong"><strong>Conditional highlighting</strong></span>, your report must contain at least one summary field or custom summary formula, which at the time of writing is available for Summary or Matrix reports.</p><p>To set up <span class="strong"><strong>Conditional highlighting</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Show</strong></span> and then on <span class="strong"><strong>Conditional Highlighting</strong></span>, as shown from within the <span class="strong"><strong>Preview</strong></span> pane on the report builder page:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_06_026-2.jpg" alt="Conditional highlighting"/></div><p>
</p><p>You then have the option to set colors according to whether the value falls below a low breakpoint threshold, above a high breakpoint threshold, or a value that sits between the range of values. The following screenshot shows an example of how the thresholds might be set:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_06_027-1.jpg" alt="Conditional highlighting"/></div><p>

This means you do not have to create custom formula fields for calculated results if they are only relevant in reports.</p><p>Formulas must be 3,900 characters or fewer. Up to five formulas can be created per report. Fields available for custom summary formulas are <span class="strong"><strong>Number</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Percent</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Currency</strong></span>.

<span class="strong"><strong>Hiding details when building new reports:</strong></span></p><p>Often when building new reports, you will not necessarily know just how many records are actually going to be returned.

In these cases, you should set the <span class="strong"><strong>Hide Details</strong></span> option to prevent the detailed data being returned and show just the skeleton of the report this shows the number of rows that will be returned. Limiting rows on a Tabular report allows you to use it as a source report for dashboard table and chart Components.
