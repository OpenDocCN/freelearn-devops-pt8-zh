- en: In the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, the ability to automate and manage
    infrastructure efficiently is paramount. As organizations continue to migrate
    their workloads to the cloud, the need for a robust and scalable approach to infrastructure
    management becomes increasingly evident. Enter Terraform, a powerful **Infrastructure-as-Code**
    (**IaC**) tool that enables developers and operations teams to automate the provisioning
    and management of cloud resources with ease. When combined with the vast capabilities
    of **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**), Terraform becomes an indispensable tool
    for building, deploying, and managing complex cloud infrastructure.

    Terraform on AWS. We explore the fundamental concepts of **Infrastructure as Code**
    (**IaC**) and Terraform, including both effective patterns and common pitfalls.
    You’ll learn how to avoid typical mistakes and build your first Terraform project
    on AWS with confidence. We’ll also delve into best practices for managing Terraform
    projects, ensuring you have a solid foundation for efficient and maintainable
    IaC. By the end of this part, you’ll be well-equipped to start deploying cloud
    infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.
