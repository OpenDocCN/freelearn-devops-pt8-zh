<p class="mce-root">The first example illustrates how to incorporate an open source application and extend its use to producing PDF documents. In this example, you will learn how to integrate multiple components to build a serverless application.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The second example provides more of a challenge to you. In this use case, you will create and integrate multiple services through the use of a scalable architecture. Developer productivity will increase through the use of a CI pipeline and Cloud Build triggers that automatically build and deploy components.</p>
