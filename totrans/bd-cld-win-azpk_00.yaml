    as Windows Server and System Center and provides cloud offerings including IaaS
    and PaaS services. Offered services aren't limited to Microsoft technologies as
    they offer a wide range of other vendor's and open source technologies such as
    Linux operating systems and MySQL Database. While cloud computing has already
    been a reality now and is no more a future technology, Windows Azure Pack provides
    a solid platform with extensible architecture to build a private cloud or service
    provider's cloud.
