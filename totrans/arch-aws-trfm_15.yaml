    can meet the demands of your users and customers. It refers to the ability of
    a system or application to remain operational and accessible in the event of hardware
    or software failures, network disruptions, or other unforeseen events. Achieving
    high availability requires careful planning and design, as well as the use of
    appropriate technologies and strategies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    multiple instances of your application or service across different availability
    zones or regions. By spreading your workload across multiple instances, you can
    ensure that if one instance fails or becomes unavailable, traffic can be routed
    to another instance, minimizing downtime and maintaining service availability.

    When designing and deploying infrastructure with Terraform in AWS, it is crucial
    to follow AWS security best practices and ensure that all resources are properly
    secured.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first steps to achieving a secure infrastructure is to establish
    **Identity and Access Management** (**IAM**) policies that control who can access
    the resources and what actions they can perform. IAM policies should be designed
    with the principle of least privilege, which means that users should only have
    access to the resources that are necessary for them to perform their duties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key aspect of security is network security. In AWS, network security
    can be achieved through the use of security groups and network **access control
    lists** (**ACLs**) to control traffic flow between resources. Security groups
    are stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for an instance,
    while network ACLs are stateless and can control traffic at the subnet level.

    various encryption options, including server-side encryption with Amazon S3, client-side
    encryption for Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS, and end-to-end encryption with AWS **Key
    Management** **Service** (**KMS**).

    operational tasks can be automated using Terraform, allowing for more efficient
    and streamlined management of infrastructure resources. Then, we examined how
    Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure changes, monitor and log infrastructure
    events, and troubleshoot infrastructure issues. Finally, we looked at how Terraform
    can be used to scale and manage infrastructure resources as needs change and evolve.
    With the help of Terraform, operations teams can gain greater control and visibility
    over their cloud infrastructure, leading to improved efficiency, security, and
    reliability.

- en: In this final chapter, we explored how to achieve perfect infrastructure with
    Terraform in AWS. We started by discussing the key considerations for designing
    and developing infrastructure that meets stakeholder needs, achieves high availability
    and security, enables scalability, and maximizes efficiency. Then, we delved into
    the importance of continuous improvement and iteration, building SLAs/SLIs/SLOs
    with SRE principles, and how to run operations with Terraform.
