- en: Monitoring your identity synchronization processes, your Active Directory health
    status, and the functionality of your ADFS and Web Application Proxy authentication
    platform is essential for your organization. Also, gathering performance data
    is necessary to provide a suitable infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this practical chapter, we'll explore the various monitoring capabilities
    for the identity bridge that's constructed by Azure AD Connect, the Active Directory
    itself and, if used, the ADFS and the Web Application Proxy. We'll investigate
    the Azure AD Monitoring and logs functionalities, the Azure AD Connect Health
    service, and the Azure Security Center to get a good idea of several use cases
    to provide an efficient and accurate monitoring to deliver a stable and suitable
    identity infrastructure for connecting to Azure AD.

    into the identity infrastructure used to extend on-premises identities to Azure
    Active Directory and Office 365\. You can view alerts, performance information,
    usage patterns, and configuration settings; it enables you to maintain a reliable
    connection to Office 365 and much more. This is accomplished by using an agent
    that's installed on the targeted servers.

    log information through the log-analytics integration, which can be used on the
    top of the portal. We highly recommend that you come back to the monitoring portals

    your identity infrastructure in a stable and suitable state. We learned which
    functionality is provided by the Azure AD section in the Azure portal. Furthermore,
    we saw how Azure AD Connect Health works and how easy it is to install and configure
    your environment. We extended our solution and now have a broader view of the
    whole security state of the hybrid environment through the Azure Security Center.
    You should be able to answer questions about the identity infrastructure-monitoring
    capabilities and to configure a suitable monitoring and log solution for your
    own organization or customers.
