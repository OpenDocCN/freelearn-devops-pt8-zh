- en: In the previous chapter, we looked at user authentication and how user login
    access is authorized by the Salesforce application. We were introduced to the
    concept of a user being assigned a profile that could be set to control certain
    permissions. The user profile login permissions we looked at were restrictions
    on login hours and IP addresses, which allow you to control when, and from where,
    users log in to the Salesforce application.

    understand how some of the key profile settings are used within the Salesforce
    CRM application.

    sharing and provides a high-level look at sharing features within Salesforce.

    introduction to the concepts of record owner, profiles, and sharing in Salesforce
    CRM.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and every data record there can be one, and only one, record owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only users that are active in Salesforce can have records assigned to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a user is marked inactive in Salesforce CRM, he/she no longer has access
    to the application. However, any records that this inactive user owns remain in
    the application and continue to show the inactive user as the record owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to other users within the organization, and is enabled using either profile or
    sharing settings.

    should be considered as a whole when setting up record ownership and data access
    for users. An overview of the relationship between users, profiles, and the sharing
    settings can be pictured as follows:'

- en: All users in Salesforce must be assigned a profile. The profile is a control
    mechanism used to determine which functions the user can perform, which types
    of data they can access, and which operations they can carry out on that data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All users are associated with sharing mechanisms in Salesforce, which determine
    the actual records the user can access. Controlling the level of record access
    can be achieved using options ranging from default sharing, which is set at the
    organization level, to role hierarchy and beyond using advanced sharing mechanisms.
    A user does not have to be assigned to a role in Salesforce.
  prefs: []

    later in this book.

- en: Profiles
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the key controls of the profile are to identify the type of license
    specified for the user, any login hours or IP address restrictions, and control
    access to objects. If the appropriate object-level permission is not set on the
    user's profile, the user will be unable to access the records of that object type
    in the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Profiles never override your organization's sharing model or role hierarchy.
    For example, a profile may be set to allow a user access to create, edit, and
    delete leads. However, a user with this profile cannot edit or delete other user's
    leads if your organization's lead sharing model is read-only.

    Objects and Apps*, we will look in detail at the features that the profile controls,
    which includes tabs, object-level security, field-level security, Apex/Visualforce
    page accessibility, console layout, application selections, and administrative
    and general user permissions.

    being that for standard profiles, the following types of settings cannot be applied:

    plus, notably, the **password never expires** setting, which means you are not
    required to change your password after a certain amount of time (this is a part
    of the password policies, which are described later). Hence, you must either create
    a custom profile or use a permission set, (described later in this chapter), if
    you want to enable any of those features.'

    the leads and assign it to a user who has a profile, which does not provide lead
    conversion. You can create a permission called **Edit Contacts** and assign it
    to a user who has a profile that does not provide contact editing. You can also
    group these permissions into a permission set to create specific profile-like
    permissions without actually having to create or clone complete profiles, which
    are often unnecessary.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Salesforce does not recommend overwriting inactive user records with new user
    data. Doing so prevents you from tracking the history of past users and the records
    associated with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also situations where you may feel it appropriate to recycle an active
    user record, but it is better to deactivate users when they are no longer using
    Salesforce and create a new record for each new user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical real-world example of recycling a user record, and one to avoid, is
    sometimes encountered when a sales team is organized into sales territories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sales team user records in Salesforce are stamped with a territory indicator
    and any account records that are located in their particular territory are assigned
    to the user record (set as the record owner). In this way, the user record simply
    acts as a container for the territory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Managing user records in this way results in both audit and maintenance issues.
    For example, if Tina Fox changes sales territory, her personal information (username,
    password, e-mail address, phone number, and so on) all has to be transferred to
    a new user record requiring Tina to reactivate a new password, re-enter both her
    personal details, and all her personal preferences in the Salesforce application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The issue worsens if the user record (or territory) that Tina is reassigning
    to, is held by, say, Timothy Little as he would also need to reset his personal
    details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach leads to a technically complex method of territory reassignment
    and a very disappointing user experience for your sales team. Fortunately, Salesforce
    provides features such as criteria-based sharing rules, sales teams, and territory
    management to better manage the organization of sales territories.

    timeout period. So if you have a 2-hour timeout, the system does not check for
    activity until 1 hour has passed. As an example, say you have a 2-hour timeout
    value. If you update a record after 30 minutes, the last active session value
    is not updated because there was no activity after 1 hour and hence you will still
    be logged out in a further 1 hour and 30 minutes because the last active session
