- en: The Cloud OS is Microsoft's hybrid cloud solution comprised of Windows Server,
    Windows Azure, System Center, Windows Intune, and SQL Server. Microsoft Cloud
    OS vision enables one consistent platform and experience of cloud services hosted
    inside Microsoft Azure Public Cloud data center, in a customer's on-premises data
    center, or in a service provider data center. Cloud OS essentially does the same
    traditional infrastructure operations such as provisioning servers and applications,
    but with cloud scale capabilities and efficiencies.

- en: Windows Azure Pack is a Microsoft solution which integrates with Windows Server
    2012 R2, System Center Suite, SQL, and IIS Servers. Together, these provide an
    enterprise class cloud solution for both organizations and service providers.
    Windows Azure Pack brings the capabilities of Microsoft Public Cloud, that is,
    Microsoft Azure's capabilities to your data center.

- en: Windows Azure Pack consists of a collection of Azure technologies which enables
    organizations to have enterprise class self-service and multitenant cloud along
    with consistent Microsoft Azure Public Cloud experience. Eliminating the confusion,
    Windows Azure Pack runs independently with Microsoft Azure Cloud, and is deployed
    in your own organization's data center; managed and operated by your organization
    only.

- en: In today's era of cloud computing, IT departments of organizations are turning
    into IT service providers for their different teams and LOBs. In traditional computing
    models, different teams approach their IT departments for their IT needs, which
    becomes quite a lengthy process involving several levels of approvals, procurement
    of HW/SW, implementations, services, schedules, and much more. In this model,
    infrastructure readiness itself takes considerable amount of time and resources,
    resulting in various constraints when it comes to application deployment. The
    situation gets even worse when it comes to test and development environment-related
    requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A private cloud helps in eliminating these challenges drastically. For example,
    with a private cloud solution a development team can request for a VM with required
    specification and middleware components using an easy to use self-service portal
    without getting into manual e-mail threads with IT infra provider departments.
    In such a private cloud infrastructure, a development team can expect to have
    a server ready for applications usage in a matter of minutes, whereas in a traditional
    model it could have taken days.
