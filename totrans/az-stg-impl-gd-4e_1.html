			<p>Today's businesses face significant challenges, from enabling remote work and responding to increased cyberattacks to managing reduced cash flow. Microsoft Azure is a powerful cloud platform designed to help you empower productivity, ensure security, drive efficiency, and save money, enabling you to deliver resiliency, cost savings, and the impact your company requires. Whether you are a start-up or a multinational enterprise operating all over the world, you can start deploying and migrating workloads to Azure with an approach that meets your business needs.</p>
			<p>The first step in taking advantage of the many capabilities offered by Azure is careful planning. This book has been created to help you undertake this planning successfully by providing you with a foundational understanding of Azure infrastructure, its core capabilities and benefits, and best practices that will help you successfully use Azure, whether you decide to fully migrate or run a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
			<p>This chapter will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is Microsoft Azure?</li>
				<li>Approaches for Azure adoption</li>
				<li>Azure migration strategies</li>
				<li>Business benefits of Azure infrastructure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter will introduce you to the framework and an overview of the business benefits of Azure. The following chapters will build on that, providing more specific guidance and an explanation of the technologies that will help you plan your migration and Azure infrastructure implementation strategies.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>What is Microsoft Azure?</h2>
			<p>Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It provides a variety of services to both individuals and organizations. Cloud computing enables convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources over the network. These resources can range from storage and servers to applications that can be deployed rapidly.</p>
			<p>Azure provides rapid provisioning of compute resources to help you host your existing applications, streamline new application development, and even enhance on-premises applications. These resources are managed by Microsoft; however, you can monitor them and get reports and alerts when issues arise. This is all built on top of resource pools that can be dynamically assigned to the required services, which can include CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.</p>
			<p>There are four categories of service models offered by Azure, which are <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Software as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>), and Serverless. Azure IaaS is an instant computing infrastructure that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand and is provisioned and managed over the internet.</p>
			<p>It is critical to understand how you can leverage each of these service models to meet your ever-changing demands. When you use Azure, you have a shared responsibility with regard to the resources you deploy. In <em class="italics">Figure 1.1</em>, you can see the extent to which you share and manage workload responsibilities with Microsoft for each of the service models, allowing you to focus on resources that are important for your application:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure">Figure 1.1: Cloud computing models</p>
			<p>Depending on the level of responsibilities you'd like to manage compared to what Azure manages, you can determine which cloud service model works best for your organization. Different models afford you different degrees of control over the development environment, the ability to refactor your apps, your time-to-market goals, and so on. Your responsibilities generally increase as you move from SaaS to PaaS to IaaS. The separation of responsibilities will be covered in depth in <em class="italics">Chapter 2, Automation and governance in Azure</em>, in the <em class="italics">Identity and access control</em> section. </p>
			<p>For the remainder of this book, we will be focusing on IaaS. IaaS gives you the most control over the environment as Microsoft provides the foundational infrastructure while you manage the applications. This approach is great for organizations that are looking to customize their cloud solutions for their business applications. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Approaches for Azure adoption</h2>
			<p>As you consider Azure adoption for your cloud infrastructure strategy, you can choose from different ways to deploy cloud services—public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, multiple clouds, and at the edge of networks. Deciding between these computing environments can depend on a variety of factors.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at each of these approaches.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Public cloud</h3>
			<p>The most common type of cloud computing service is a public cloud, which is provided by third-party cloud providers and delivered over the public internet. The resources in these public cloud environments are owned and managed by the underlying cloud provider, which in the case of Azure is Microsoft. In public clouds, resources are shared with other organizations or cloud tenants; these can include services such as email, CRM, VMs, and databases. </p>
			<p>Some common public cloud use cases involve organizations who want to expose their public workloads, such as public websites or mobile apps. These types of applications have workloads with multiple layers of UI and services in order for them to function. A good example of this is Microsoft's Office products on different platforms, such as desktop, web, and mobile. These offerings are accomplished with the UI being separate from the services, with each implementation using the services and cloud infrastructure behind the scenes to deliver the same experience regardless of the platform.</p>
			<p>Azure offers several advantages as a public cloud:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Azure is built on a vast network of servers and regions, which helps to protect against failures and guarantees high reliability.</li>
				<li>Azure can achieve near-unlimited scalability by providing on-demand services to meet your organization's needs.</li>
				<li>Azure provides both hardware and software at much lower costs compared to on-premises models, as you pay on a consumption basis.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Private cloud</h3>
			<p>As the name suggests, a private cloud comprises cloud computing resources—hardware and software—used exclusively by one business or organization, with both services and infrastructure being maintained on a private network. A third-party service provider can host a private cloud, or it can be located at an on-site datacenter.</p>
			<p>Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions, or healthcare providers to meet specific regulatory and IT requirements with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment. On-premises environments can expand to Azure by using Azure ExpressRoute or a site-to-site VPN tunnel to connect workloads while keeping them isolated from public view. We will take a deeper look into these core Azure infrastructure components in <em class="italics">Chapter 5, Enabling secure, remote work with Microsoft Azure AD and WVD.</em></p>
			<p>The advantages of choosing a private cloud are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Greater control over your resources as they are not shared with others.</li>
				<li>Greater flexibility in customizing the environment to meet specific business needs.</li>
				<li>Better scalability when compared to on-premises infrastructures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These types of cloud-based solutions are a bit more costly because of the infrastructure needed to isolate and access the organization's workloads.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Hybrid cloud</h3>
			<p>A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines an on-premises datacenter with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Hybrid clouds allow businesses to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure into the cloud when processing demand increases and scale back that infrastructure when demand decreases. Hybrid cloud also allows the flexibility to use new cloud-first technologies for new or migrated workloads while keeping other business-critical applications and data on-premises due to migration costs and business or regulatory compliance.</p>
			<p>To illustrate, let's think about a tax company scenario. Tax companies generally need large compute only three months out of the year, which can be costly. Rather than investing a large amount of capital in additional on-premises servers to support peak capacity, they can use a hybrid environment in the cloud to expand and contract their compute on demand. This would allow them to keep costs down by only paying for what they use.</p>
			<p>Azure offers unique hybrid capabilities that give customers the flexibility to innovate anywhere, whether on-premises, across clouds, or in edge environments. There are different hybrid usage models in Azure that can help you reduce the cost of running your workloads in the cloud. For example, Azure Hybrid Benefit lets you bring your existing on-premises server licenses to Azure to maximize cost savings. This is referred to as the Hybrid licensing model and applies to most server-based licensing. </p>
			<p>Microsoft also has unique industry-specific cloud offerings, such as Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services, Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing, and Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit. These industry clouds marry the whole range of Microsoft's cloud services with industry-specific components and standards, workflows, and APIs to provide tailored solutions to industry challenges, so businesses can target the areas that require technological transformation the most.</p>
			<p>Hybrid clouds should not be considered a temporary middle ground that organizations inhabit only while they transition from on-premises to Azure. Instead, a hybrid cloud can be a strategy employed by organizations to find a stable solution that best addresses their information-technology needs.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Multicloud</h3>
			<p>A multicloud approach involves the use of multiple cloud computing services from more than one cloud provider. This allows you to mix and match services from different providers to get the best combination for a particular task or capitalize on offerings in specific locations, whether they are public or private clouds.</p>
			<p>For instance, customers may choose a multicloud strategy to meet regulatory or data sovereignty requirements in different countries. This may also be done to improve business continuity and disaster recovery, for example, backing up on-premises data in two public clouds for business units, subsidiaries, or acquired companies that adopt different cloud platforms.</p>
			<p>Multicloud models can become very complex as they require management across multiple platforms. Microsoft Azure provides solutions to help you operate your hybrid cloud seamlessly, which you can read about at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-app/">https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-app/</a>. One such solution is Azure Arc, a multicloud management technology. Azure Arc extends Azure management and services with a single control plane across hybrid, multicloud, and edge environments, enabling a consistent state across resource environments and infrastructure. It provides greater visibility of resources, team accountability, and developer empowerment while accelerating innovation from Azure to any location.</p>
			<p>Both hybrid cloud and multicloud solutions will be covered in more detail in <em class="italics">Chapter 3, Modernizing with hybrid cloud and multicloud</em>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Edge computing</h3>
			<p>Edge computing combines the power of the cloud with <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) devices. At edge locations, close to where the data resides, you can run virtual machines, data services, and containers using edge computing to gain insights in real time and reduce latency. At the edge of the network, your devices spend less time communicating with the cloud and operate reliably even through extended offline periods.</p>
			<p>The wide adoption of smart sensors and connected devices, along with state-of-the-art cloud technologies such as machine learning and AI, means IoT devices are highly responsive to local changes and are contextually aware. There are also security benefits given the distributed nature of edge computing systems, which makes it difficult for a single disruption to compromise the entire network.  </p>
			<p>This can become beneficial for something like fleet tracking. With the help of Azure, the <strong class="bold">United Nations Development Programme</strong> (<strong class="bold">UNDP</strong>) devised a fleet management solution using IoT technology and enabled devices to gain new insights. These IoT tracking devices send a significant amount of telemetry data when they are connected to the internet and store this data locally in the absence of a connection. This has allowed the UNDP to move and manage its fleet of vehicles as it coordinates around 12,000 staff members in a mission to eradicate poverty through sustainable development.

			<p>We have seen the different ways you can adopt Azure in your cloud infrastructure strategy, so let's discuss how Azure migration actually works in more detail. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Azure migration strategies</h2>
			<p>Microsoft Azure gives organizations the ability to push an already existing infrastructure to the cloud, moving either some of their workloads for a hybrid cloud approach, or the entire infrastructure—this is referred to as <em class="italics">migration</em>. From migrating legacy applications to deploying applications on Azure, organizations need to determine their requirements beforehand and plan a migration strategy.</p>
			<p>Migrating to Azure can be accomplished in several ways based on two important considerations. The first is which type of deployment model you'd like to use: public Azure, private cloud, hybrid Azure, or multicloud. The second is the service category or type: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, or Serverless. These migration strategies will help you understand which approach may be optimal for moving your workloads to Azure.</p>
			<p>There are three different strategies to accomplish migration to Azure: re-hosting, re-platforming, and refactoring.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Re-hosting</h3>
			<p>Re-hosting, or lifting and shifting, is the process of taking an on-premises application host or VM and moving it directly to Azure. It is the fastest and easiest way to move because it has the fewest dependencies, the lowest business impact, and no constraints. Re-hosting your application is recommended in scenarios where speed of delivery is needed.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Re-platforming</h3>
			<p>Re-platforming, or redeploying, is when you want to take something like the <strong class="bold">Internet Information Services </strong>(<strong class="bold">IIS</strong>) on a VM and move it out to a PaaS offering in Azure. This means you won't need to manage the OS, just the application itself. It can generally be performed by simply redirecting your DevOps process to redeploy to the new infrastructure, though there can be third-party DLLs and restrictions that may cause problems in this scenario.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Refactoring</h3>
			<p>Refactoring is generally recommended when your application code isn't compliant with Azure services. It requires you to rewrite the application, or parts of the application, to conform to the ever-evolving new standards, as well as functional and security needs. It is also referred to as <em class="italics">modernization</em> of the app because you are making it more Azure native. Of the three strategies for moving to Azure, this one has the potential to have cost-overrun risk.</p>
			<p>You should note that there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to choosing between these approaches. Identifying your business goals can help you determine which migration strategy works best for your organization.</p>
			<p>Let's talk about why you might consider performing a migration to Azure.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Business benefits of Azure infrastructure</h2>
			<p>When considering your adoption of Azure infrastructure, it's helpful to understand the benefits you can realize as you make the case for your organization to migrate. The flexible and agile nature of Azure is something that an on-premises infrastructure environment simply cannot match. Furthermore, by migrating to Azure, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Azure can take care of the operational work and allow you to quickly scale up and down Azure resources to meet your business demands. You can easily provision new resources and scale up and down existing resources through the Azure portal, or programmatically via Azure PowerShell, the <strong class="bold">Azure command-line interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">Azure CLI</strong>), or REST APIs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost savings</strong>: Azure offers cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing organizations to move from a CapEx to a more agile OpEx spending model. Save money and achieve operational agility with hybrid offers, comprehensive datacenter migration programs, and cost-optimized IT infrastructure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased delivery speed</strong>: Since you don't need to wait for infrastructure to be deployed in your datacenter to access the resources you need, you'll see an accelerated time to market. The automation of the continuous integration, delivery, and deployment pipeline on the single platform that is Azure DevOps also plays a big role in this.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Innovation</strong>: You get access to all the latest technologies on Azure, such as Azure AI, Machine Learning, and IoT.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Seamlessly and securely manage hybrid environments</strong>: You can start taking advantage of Azure-based resources without having to fully migrate your entire existing on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. Furthermore, you can apply security and resiliency across these hybrid environments. Azure allows you to improve your security posture and get comprehensive insights into the threats facing your environments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As mentioned, Azure can provide resources on-demand and operates under a consumption-based model, which means you only pay for what you use. You need no longer invest in on-premises resources and applications; Azure allows you to infinitely scale your applications to perform better, with security at its forefront, benefiting small and large organizations alike.</p>
			<p>Now that we have an overview of Azure and the services it offers, in the next chapter, we will dive into some of the core technologies and solutions available to organizations.</p>
