- en: '*Mastering Identity and Access Management with Microsoft Azure* is a crisp
    and practical, hands-on guide containing project scenarios/illustrations that
    is tailored to genuine hybrid and cloud-only challenges. Developers, security
    specialists, IT consultants, and architects are the audience for this book. With
    it, you get a complete companion for solving key topics in the field of identity
    and access management through all related Microsoft technologies and practice-related
    crisp and clear content that helps you to put the theory into practice. The book
    delves into the Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance plans and other Azure services
    related to identity and access management topics.'

- en: The book is divided into three parts. In the first part, crucial identity management
    topics are covered, such as identity synchronization as a whole, including monitoring
    and protection topics, in a cloud-only and hybrid world. The second part provides
    all the essentials and in-depth knowledge pertaining to the different authentication
    methods you can use and how you can securely publish and expose your applications
    with on-premise technologies and the Azure AD feature set. The final part of the
    book focuses entirely on the Microsoft information protection technologies. Another
    highlight is the more than 40 playbooks you receive to support the learning process
    through practical tips. With this great resource, you get an information package
    that also covers the functionality of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019.

    edition with more than 85% new content?

    I was happy to listen!

- en: Since writing the first edition of the book back in 2016, many features have
    been completely updated, added, changed, or even removed. The Microsoft Azure
    world is changing very rapidly, from a pure infrastructure to an object and service-oriented
    environment. For this reason, it is necessary to include a variety of developmental
    aspects in the book. Some functions are currently changing their entitlement entirely
    to the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, no overall solution for sustainable identity and access management
    in a hybrid cloud environment is currently available to fulfill all the different
    aspects. For this reason, the basics for individual services must be developed
    to ensure a better shift of the functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important reason for me to write an updated edition was that I heard
    from readers and workshop attendees that they require more technical guidance
    and less information on the decision manager side. This brought me to an approach
    whereby I provide more than 40 hands-on guides in the book, where you can test
    all the related information in a practical and guided manner. Furthermore, our
    workshop attendees and customers found it very hard to find qualified and working
    lab examples in a compressed form to save time and effort.
  prefs: []

- en: Many of you and our attendees loved the structure of the three scenarios in
    the first book. Frequently, however, I received a request to provide the theory
    and practical guidance in technology or topic-based flows so as to make it easier
    to follow, if you are just interested in specific topics, or if you want to use
    the book as a living reference.
  prefs: []

- en: At the time of writing the first book, the Azure information protection technology
    was not available in the complete approach that it is available today. Since this
    technology is now mature and an integral aspect of access management, in my view,
    additional chapters for this topic are an absolute necessity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Windows Server 2019 is also available to use, so I updated the book to work
    with the new server version, with a primary focus on hybrid cloud scenarios.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed for cyber security specialists, system and security engineers,
    developers and IT consultants/architects who wish to plan, design, and implement
    identity and access management solutions with the help of Microsoft Azure technology.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use the book efficiently, you should have some understanding of security
    solutions, Active Directory, access privileges/rights, and authentication methods.
    Programming knowledge is not required but will be helpful for using PowerShell
    or working with APIs to customize your solutions. Working through the first edition
    of the book is not a requirement for following the chapters in this book.

- en: During the book, we will work entirely on the Azure platform itself. The only
    requirement is to have an internet connection and a Microsoft or Apple client
    computer. The labs can be undertaken free of charge for the duration of the several
    trial versions we use. We highly recommend that you shut down your virtual machines
    on Azure to save the runtime for working with your practical guidance. In [Chapter
    7](468509fa-856c-411d-abdb-e9a39c266750.xhtml), Deploying Solutions on Azure AD
    and ADFS, we will provide you the architecture overview with all the requisite
    information for sizing and the different products we use and will reference in
    the chapters. We also provide you the guidance to create public certificates with
    Let's Encrypt. One small cost requirement exists. If you want to run all the different
    labs, you need to have three public DNS domains registered, including access to
    the related public DNS. Bear in mind that this lab is for studying and testing
    functionality and not a representation of a productive environment. Follow the
    instructions in the chapters to arrange the correct resources. All the scripts
    and demo files are covered in the example code files, which you can download on
    the web page provided in the download the example code files section.
