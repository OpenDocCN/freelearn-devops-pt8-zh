- en: This chapter is a guide to the installation of Proxmox VE on a physical machine.
    After completing this chapter, you will have a working PVE server for exploration,
    experimentation, and perhaps production, depending on your hardware configuration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Along the way, the chapter will explain how to determine whether a computer's
    hardware satisfies PVE's minimal or optimal requirements. This chapter also helps
    us determine whether our configurations make the most of Intel or AMD's virtualization
    technologies. Finally, it will outline what to expect from the **Proxmox Installer**,
    and how to initiate and, ultimately, complete the installation and configuration
    of a new Proxmox VE system.
