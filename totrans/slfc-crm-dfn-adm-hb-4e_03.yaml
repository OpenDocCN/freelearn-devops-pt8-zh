    result in unexpected behavior when you reference that name in a merge field. If
    a standard field and custom field have matching names or labels, the merge field
    displays the value of the custom field. If two custom fields have matching names
    or labels, the merge field may not display the value of the field you expect.
    For example, if you create a field label called `Phone`, the field name automatically
    populates as `Phone__c`. If you also have a standard field with the label `Phone`,
    the merge field may not be able to distinguish between the standard and custom
    field names. Make the custom field name and label unique by adding a suffix to
    each, such as `Phone_Custom` and `Phone_Custom__c`, respectively.
