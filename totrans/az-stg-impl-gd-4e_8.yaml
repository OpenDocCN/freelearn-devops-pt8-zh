    Throughout the different chapters, we have reviewed how you can start your journey
    in the Azure cloud, use the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework, and adopt
    best practices to improve the quality of your workloads in the cloud. There are
    many different scenarios possible for running your workloads on Azure to meet
    your organization's solution needs. We learned how important it is to use design
    principles and realized how crucial *planning* is when moving resources to Azure.
