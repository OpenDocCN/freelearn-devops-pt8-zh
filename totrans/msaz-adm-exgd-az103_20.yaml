- en: In the previous chapter, we've covered how to manage **Azure Active Directory**
    (**Azure AD**). This chapter proceeds with the *Managing Identities* objective*.* In
    this chapter, we are going to cover how to implement and manage hybrid identities.
    We are going to install and configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize the identities
    from your on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD. Then you will learn how to
    manage Azure AD Connect. In the last part of this chapter, we will dive into password
    sync and password writeback. You will learn how to enable password sync in Azure
    AD Connect and the Azure portal. At lastly, you will learn how to manage password
    sync.

    Active Directory identities with Azure. This way, you can use the same identities
    for authentication on your on-premises environment as well as in the cloud, and
    other **software as a service** (**SaaS**) applications.

    sync component, which is a tool that is installed on a separate server inside
    your on-premises environment, and the Azure AD Connect sync service, which is
    part of Azure AD. The sync component can sync data from Active Directory and SQL
    Servers to Azure. There is also a third component named the **Active Directory
    Federation Services** (**ADFS**) component, which can be used in a scenario where
    ADFS is involved. To monitor the on-premises identity infrastructure and the different
    Azure AD components, you can use a tool named Azure AD Connect Health. The following
    diagram illustrates the architecture of Azure AD Connect:'

- en: Azure AD Connect offers support for your users to sign in with the same passwords
    to both on-premises and cloud resources. It provides three different authentication
    methods for this, the password hash synchronization method, the pass-through authentication
    method, and the Federated SSO method (in conjunction with ADFS).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most organizations only have a requirement to enable user sign in to Office
    365, SaaS applications, and other Azure AD-based resources. The password hash
    synchronization method is well suitable for those scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using this method, hashes of the user's password are synced between the on-premises
    Active Directory and Azure AD. When there are any changes to the user's password,
    the password is synced immediately, so users can always log in with the same credentials
    on-premises as well as in Azure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This authentication method also provides Azure AD Seamless **Single Sign-On**
    (**SSO**). This way, users are automatically signed in when they are using a domain-joined
    device on the corporate network. Users only have to enter their username when
    using Seamless SSO. To use Seamless SSO, you don't have to install additional
    software or components on the on-premises network. You can push this capability
    to your users using group policies.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure AD pass-through authentication offers the same capability as Azure AD
    password hash synchronization. Users can log in to their Azure resources as well
    as on-premises resources using the same credentials. The difference is that the
    passwords don't sync with Azure AD using pass-through authentication. The passwords
    are validated using the on-premises Active Directory and are not stored in the
    Azure AD at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This method is suitable for organizations that have security and compliance
    restrictions and aren't allowed to send usernames and passwords outside the on-premises
    network. Pass-through authentication requires an agent to be installed on a domain-joined
    Windows server that resides inside the on-premises environment. This agent then
    listens for password validation requests and only makes an outbound connection
    from within your network. It also offers support for **Multi-Factor Authentication**
    (**MFA**) and Azure AD conditional access policies.
