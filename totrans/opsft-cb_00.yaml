- en: OpenShift is an open source, polyglot, and scalable Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    from Red Hat. At the time of writing this, OpenShift officially supports the Java,
    Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Perl programming language runtimes, along with
    the MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases. It also offers Jenkins CI, RockMongo,
    Mongo Monitoring Service agent, phpMyAdmin, and a lot of other features. OpenShift,
    being extensible in nature, allows developers to extend it by adding support for
    runtimes, databases, and other services, which OpenShift currently does not support.
    Developers can work with OpenShift using command-line tools, IDE integrations,
    or a web console. OpenShift manages application deployment using a popular version
    control system named Git. The OpenShift PaaS has made cloud-enabled web application
    development an easy process. It is straightforward to deploy existing or new applications
    on OpenShift. Many developers around the world are making use of the OpenShift
    capabilities to develop and deploy faster.

- en: Getting started with OpenShift is easy, but as is the case with many of the
    tools we use to develop web applications, it can take time to appreciate all the
    capabilities of OpenShift. The OpenShift platform and its client tools are full
    of features you might never have known to wish for. Once you know about them,
    they can make you more productive and help in writing scalable web applications.

    manner. It will walk you through a number of recipes, showcasing the OpenShift
    features and demonstrating how to deploy a particular technology or framework
    on it. You can quickly learn and start deploying applications on OpenShift immediately.
    The cookbook also covers topics such as horizontal scaling and application logging
    and monitoring. The recipes covered address the common, everyday problems required
    to effectively run applications on OpenShift. The reader is assumed to be familiar
    with the PaaS and cloud computing concepts. The book does not need to be read
    from cover to cover, which enables the reader to choose chapters and recipes that
    are of interest. *OpenShift Cookbook* is an easy read and is packed with practical
    recipes and helpful screenshots.'
