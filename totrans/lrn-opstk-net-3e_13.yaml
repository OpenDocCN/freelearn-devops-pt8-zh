- en: The Neutron load-balancing-as-a-service plugin, known as LBaaS v2, provides
    users with the ability to load balance traffic to applications running on virtual
    instances in the cloud. Neutron provides an API to manage load balancers, listeners,
    pools, members, and health monitors.

    Pike, the reference driver deploys HAProxy within network namespaces. HAProxy
    is a free, open source load balancer that is available for most Linux-based operating
    systems. Octavia is another open source load balancing solution that is compatible
    with the LBaaS v2 API. Rather than use network namespaces, however, Octavia spins
    up and manages a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare-metal servers
    known as amphorae that act as load balancers. This allows Octavia to scale horizontally
    and on-demand. Deploying Octavia and other third-party drivers from vendors such
    as F5, Citrix, Radware, and more is possible, but outside the scope of this book.

- en: A load balancer is an object that represents a virtual IP and is associated
    with a Neutron port. A virtual IP is often exposed to the internet and mapped
    to a domain name to provide access to an internet-facing load balanced service.
    Virtual IPs can also be created for services limited to internal clients. Traffic
    to the virtual IP is distributed among pool members and provides scaling and resiliency
    to the application.

    to the next server in line. Over time, all connections will be distributed evenly
    across all machines being load balanced. Round robin is the least resource-intensive
    algorithm and has no mechanism to determine when a machine is being overwhelmed
    by connections. To avoid overwhelming a pool member, all members should be equal
    in terms of processing speed, connection speed, and memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the least connections algorithm, the load balancer passes a new connection
    to a server that has the least number of current connections. It is considered
    a dynamic algorithm, as the system keeps track of the number of connections attached
    to each server and balances traffic accordingly. Pool members of higher capabilities
    will likely receive more traffic, as they are able to process connections quicker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the source IP algorithm, all connections originating from the same source
    IP address are sent to the same pool member. Connections are initially balanced
    using the round robin algorithm and are then tracked in a table for future lookup
    with subsequent connections from the same IP address. This algorithm is useful
    in cases where the application requires clients to persist to a particular server
    for all requests, such as an online shopping cart that stores session information
    on the local web server.

    from the same IP address to the same backend pool member. Based on the configuration,
    up to 10,000 sticky entries can exist in the sticky table. This persistence method
    can cause load imbalance between pool members if users connect from behind a proxy
    server that misidentifies multiple clients as a single address.

    to the next pool member in line. When the pool member sends its response, HAProxy
    injects a cookie named SRV into the response before sending it to the client.
    The value of the SRV cookie is a unique server identifier. When the client sends
    subsequent requests to the virtual IP, HAProxy strips the cookie from the request
    header and sends the traffic directly to the pool member identified in the cookie.
    This persistence method is recommended over source IP persistence, as it is not
    reliant on the IP address of the client. However, it may not be compatible with
    all clients.

    it with the server's identifier. Up to 56 characters from the value will be retained.
    On subsequent client connections, HAProxy will look for the cookie in the client's
    request. If a known value is found, the client is directed to the pool member
    associated with the value. Otherwise, the round-robin load balancing algorithm
    is applied. Cookies are automatically removed from memory when they have gone
    unused for a duration longer than three hours.

    and forwards it to web1\. The load balancer will modify the source IP of the request
    to its own address, 192.168.200.12, before forwarding the request to the pool
    member. This ensures that the member sends the response back to the load balancer,
    which will then rewrite the destination IP as the client address. If the server
    were to send the response directly to the client, the client would reject the
    packet.
  prefs: []

- en: Neutron configures HAProxy to send an `HTTP ``X-Forwarded-For` header to the
    pool member, which allows the member to see the original client address. Without
    this header, all traffic will be identified as coming from the load balancer,
    which may skew application reporting data and persistence efforts.
  prefs: []

- en: Alternatives to one-arm mode include routed mode and transparent mode. In routed
    mode, the load balancer acts as a gateway between the client and pool member.
    The source addresses of packets do not need to be manipulated in most cases, as
    the load balancer servers as the gateway for pool members.

    VLANs configured with the same subnet(s). Using this mode allows users to introduce

    the pool member would be eligible to receive connections. If a 500 status code
    were returned, it could indicate that the server is not properly processing connections.
