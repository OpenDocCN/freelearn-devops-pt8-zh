- en: Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate all your
    IT configurations, giving you control over what you do with each Puppet agent
    in a network, and when and how you do it. In this age of digital delivery and
    ubiquitous internet presence, it's becoming increasingly important to implement
    scalable and portable solutions, not only in terms of software but also the system
    that runs it.
