    fortunes of states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending
    classes - the landlords and farmers, the workers and capitalists - revere yet
    fear the relentless abstraction of the world on which their fortunes yet depend.
    All the classes but one. The hacker class."**"The virtual is the true domain of
    the hacker. It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions
    of the actual. To the hacker, what is represented as being real is always partial,
    limited, perhaps even false. To the hacker there is always a surplus of possibility
    expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible
    domain of what is real without being actual, what is not but which may be. To
    hack is to release the virtual into the actual, to express the difference of the
    real."* |   |'

- en: Not so many years ago, it would've taken three computers to author this book
    efficiently on the go. Virtualization, however, has made it possible to write
    without the obscene hassle of dragging about so much baggage. Virtualization has
    reduced labor and energy expenditure and maximized productivity and discretionary
    time during the writing and production of this book.

    privilege of nostalgia—tractor-fed edge strips, darkroom chemicals, printing presses
    and type-set trays, overflowing money bags with dollar signs, and of course, cramped
    server rooms.

- en: Through server virtualization, the abstraction of computing resources from physical
    systems has overturned data centers and radically upset the traditional and repetitive
    routines of system engineers and administrators in favor of efficiency, conservation,
    lowered expenditure, secure systems, and the simple deployment of automation to
    complete repetitive tasks.
