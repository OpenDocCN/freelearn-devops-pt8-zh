- en: Azure is an ever-evolving platform. It offers an environment on the cutting
    edge of technology that suits many different industry requirements. New capabilities
    and features are coming out fast, which makes it difficult to stay up to date.
    This book will give you a complete overview of all the current features and capabilities
    that Azure has to offer from an administrative perspective, and is a complete
    guide to preparing for the AZ-103 exam.

- en: This book will cover all the exam objectives. It will start with how to manage
    Azure subscriptions and resources, where you will learn how to manage Azure subscriptions
    and resource groups, analyze resource utilization and consumption, and manage **role-based
    access control** (**RBAC**). In the second part, you will learn how to implement
    and manage storage by creating and configuring storage accounts, how to import
    and export data to Azure, and how to configure Azure Files and implement Azure
    Backup. The third part will cover how to deploy and manage **virtual machines**
    (**VMs**), where you will learn how to create and configure VMs for Windows and
    Linux and how to manage Azure VMs and VM backups. The fourth part of this book
    will cover how to configure and manage virtual networks, by covering implementing
    and managing virtual networking; how to integrate on-premise networks with Azure
    virtual networks; how to monitor and troubleshoot virtual networking; how to create
    and manage Azure Security Groups and Azure DNS; and how to implement Azure Load
    Balancer. The last part of this book will cover how to manage identities, where
    you will learn how to manage Azure **Active Directory** (**AD**), how to implement
    and manage hybrid identities, and how to implement **multi-factor authentication**
    (**MFA**).

    important part of each chapter, as it will give you extra, and sometimes crucial,
    information for passing the AZ-103 exam. As the questions on the exam will change
    slightly over time and this book will eventually become outdated, the *Further
    reading* sections will be the place that will provide you with all the updates.
