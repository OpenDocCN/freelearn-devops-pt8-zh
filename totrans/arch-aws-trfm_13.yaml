    of IT resources, including hardware, software, and data. It is the practice of
    defining policies, procedures, and guidelines to ensure that IT resources are
    used efficiently, securely, and in compliance with regulatory requirements. In
    the context of cloud computing, infrastructure governance is the process of managing
    and controlling the use of cloud resources, such as servers, storage, and networking,
    to ensure that they are used effectively and efficiently.

    especially true for cloud-based resources. AWS, with its vast array of services,
    provides a lot of flexibility and power for developers and operations teams, but
    it also requires careful governance to ensure resources are used efficiently,
    securely, and cost-effectively. Terraform provides a powerful tool for managing
    AWS infrastructure, but to truly govern AWS resources, it’s important to understand
    the fundamentals of infrastructure governance, the importance of AWS resource
    governance, and the tools and automation available to govern AWS Terraform projects.

    part of governance. Automation ensures that the build and deployment processes
    are predictable and repeatable, reducing the risk of human error and increasing
    the speed of development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pipelines are the foundation of automation in IaC projects. A pipeline is a
    series of steps that are executed in sequence to build, test, and deploy the infrastructure.
    Pipelines typically include stages for linting, testing, building, and deploying
    the infrastructure. The steps in each stage are executed in sequence, and if any
    step fails, the entire pipeline is aborted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To implement a pipeline for your IaC project, you will need to choose a pipeline
    tool that integrates with your version control system and infrastructure platform.
    Some popular pipeline tools for IaC projects include Jenkins, GitHub Actions,
    Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, and GitLab CI/CD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have chosen a pipeline tool, you will need to define the stages and
    steps in your pipeline. Each step in the pipeline should be defined as a separate
    script or executable that can be run independently. This makes it easy to test
    and debug individual steps and also makes it easier to maintain and update the
    pipeline as your infrastructure changes.

    to store and manage your credentials and other sensitive information. You should
    also use automated testing tools to ensure that your infrastructure is secure
    and compliant with your organization’s policies and standards.

- en: Overall, building and deploying IaC with automation and pipelines is a critical
    part of governance. Automation ensures that the build and deployment processes
    are predictable and repeatable, while pipelines provide a framework for testing,
    building, and deploying the infrastructure. By implementing automation and pipelines
    in your IaC projects, you can reduce the risk of human error, increase the speed
    of development, and ensure that your infrastructure is secure and compliant with
    your organization’s policies and standards.

    governance. Terraform provides several features that can help manage costs and
    track expenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to track costs is to use Terraform’s ability to set budgets and configure
    alerts based on cost metrics. With AWS, Terraform can integrate with the AWS Budgets
    service to set and track budgets, as well as send notifications when budgets are
    exceeded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to manage costs is to use Terraform’s ability to provision infrastructure
    based on specific cost requirements. For example, using the `aws_instance` resource,
    it’s possible to specify the `instance_type` parameter to provision instances
    that fit within specific price ranges.

    cloud resources, especially when dealing with large and complex environments.
    Terraform provides a powerful platform to implement governance policies and automate
    infrastructure management, allowing organizations to achieve cost savings, security,
    and compliance goals. By following best practices for resource provisioning, access
    and permissions, security, logging and monitoring, resource naming, version control
    and collaboration, automation and pipelines, cost tracking, and compliance policies,
    organizations can establish a strong governance framework for their AWS infrastructure.
    With the right tools and processes in place, teams can ensure that their AWS Terraform
