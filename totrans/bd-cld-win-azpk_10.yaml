    Azure Pack which provides flexibilities to facilitate custom cloud service offerings.
    In this chapter, we will be discussing about a few available extensions for WAP
    developed by Microsoft's partners and third-party vendors.

    cloud platform named Microsoft Azure Stack; Azure Stack isn't the next version
    to Azure Pack. It works on a different architecture and enables a consistent experience
    to the Azure preview portal of Microsoft's public cloud.

    for IaaS services. Resource providers will communicate directly with fabric components
    including Windows Servers and Hyper-V. Azure Stack is expected to deliver more
    Azure-like services including infrastructure, VMs, storage (blob), networks, applications
    (Azure Service Fabric), web applications, service bus, Azure Resource Manager,
    and so on. Azure Stack isn't expected to deliver all the things that Azure carries,
    but the list will be definitely long while comparing Azure Stack with Windows
    Azure Pack.
