    allow you to automate and streamline key business processes for your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Workflow rules can be used to capture key business processes and events to generate
    automated actions. They allow you to configure various types of actions to fire
    based on the field or fields of the record, meeting predefined conditions. In
    essence, a workflow rule sets workflow actions into motion when its predefined
    conditions are met. You can configure workflow actions to execute immediately
    whenever a record meets the conditions specified in the workflow rule, or you
    can set time-dependent features that execute the workflow actions on a specific
    day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Approval processes are a structured set of steps used to facilitate formal sign-off
    on data records. They can range from simple, single steps to complex, sophisticated
    routing to provide automated processing that your organization can use to approve
    records in Salesforce CRM. Along with the steps that must be taken, the approval
    process also specifies who must approve these steps. Approval steps can either
    be specified for all records included in the process or restricted to records
    that have certain attributes. Approval processes also specify the actions that
    are to be taken when a record is first submitted, approved, rejected, or recalled.
  prefs: []

    quality and consistency of data, increasing data integrity, improving efficiency
    and productivity, lowering costs, and reducing risks.

- en: 'Workflow rules and approval processes allow you to automate the following types
    of actions: e-mail alerts, tasks, field updates, and outbound messages.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: E-mail alerts can be sent to one or more recipients. For example, e-mail alert
    actions can be used to automatically send an account owner an e-mail whenever
    updates are made to one of their accounts by another user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tasks can be assigned to users or record owners. For example, task actions can
    be used to automatically assign follow-up tasks to a marketing executive whenever
    a new lead is entered in the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Field updates can be used to modify the value of a field on a record. For example,
    a field update action can be used to automatically update an opportunity field
    called **Next Step** when it reaches a certain sales stage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outbound messages can be used to send a secure configurable API message (in
    XML format) to a designated listener. For example, outbound messages can be used
    to automatically invoke a new account creation process. This could be, say, whenever
    a new account is entered in the Salesforce CRM application by triggering an outbound
    API message to an external financial system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Workflow rules in Salesforce CRM can be combined to help manage an entire process.
    For example, when a lead is entered through your website using the Web to lead
    (covered later), workflow rules can be used to automatically send a responding
    e-mail to the lead contact and also to someone within your organization. Here,
    a workflow rule can be set to create a task for one of your salespersons to telephone
    the lead contact along with a reminder e-mail alert, to be sent a specified number
    of days after the lead record has been entered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the salesperson changes the lead status, then a date field could be updated
    automatically with the date that the lead was contacted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up until now, we have looked at the similarity of workflow rules and approval
    processes. However, there are some key differences. Workflow rules consist of
    a single step and a single result, whereas approval processes consist of multiple
    steps and different results depending upon whether the record is approved or rejected.
    Workflow rules trigger automatically and the rules, when triggered, are not visible
    to the user. Approval processes, on the other hand, contain multiple steps, each
    requiring a specific I approve or reject user action by the specified approver(s).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, the first step in creating workflow rules and approval processes
    is to define and map out the process and, for each step in the process, detail
    the objects, the criteria, the users, and the actions required.

    process that must be completed prior to moving forward with the business activities.
    They also provide great visibility into the timeliness of the business process.
    Here, you can use approvals to capture the length of time it takes to get expenses,
    say, approved, which can then help to put measures in place to improve organizational
    processes.

    rules and instead can be carried out using lead assignment rules (see [Chapter
    8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative
    Features of Salesforce CRM"), *Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Collaborative
    Features of Salesforce CRM*).

    is set to evaluate when the record is created, and every time it's edited.

    which users are initially involved with the approval process, **b**) Approval
    processes can be set to allow users to choose a user to send the approval to,
    and **d**) Approval processes show an error message if the record does not meet
    the entry criteria.

    Approval processes can be set to automatically assign approvers from a queue but
    not to allow users to choose a queue to send the approval to. Approval processes
    show an error message only, and not a warning message showing the entry criteria
    if the record does not meet the entry criteria.'
