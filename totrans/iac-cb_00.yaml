- en: In continuously evolving environments, operations and development teams are
    increasingly working together, using tools and techniques and sharing a common
    culture popularized as part of the DevOps movement. From development to production,
    a common tooling and approach emerged—often borrowed from developers and the agile
    techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that APIs are everywhere in the datacenter, automation took over every aspect
    and every step of what used to be a sysadmin or IT job—infrastructure is now basically
    code, and should be considered as such while working alone in development or in
    production within a distributed team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning the most important tools, techniques, and workflows that fit in an
    infrastructure-as-code description can be a daunting task, and many teams can
    either be misled or discouraged by the amount of information, change, and knowledge
    required to switch to infrastructure-as-code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has been written keeping in mind all those teams that we have met
    in the past few years through our respective jobs—teams interested in DevOps,
    automation, and code, sometimes already doing part of it quite well, but willing
    to discover other tools and techniques, discovering how they could do better by
    improving the quality of their code, the stability of their infrastructure, the
    scalability of their services, the speed of their deployments, the efficiency
    of team work, and the feedback loop.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a humble attempt to cover everything related to infrastructure-as-code,
    based on our real-life experience, from development workflows with Vagrant to
    complex production infrastructure deployments with Terraform or Ansible, from
    configuration management essentials using Chef and Puppet to advanced Test-Driven
    Development (TDD) techniques, and thorough infrastructure code coverage testing.
    It will also give insights and advanced Docker techniques, and much more. Whenever
    it was possible or relevant, we tried to show alternative ways of doing the same
    thing with another tool or approach, so that everyone with any prior knowledge
    of the subject can still find something to learn in any section of the book.
