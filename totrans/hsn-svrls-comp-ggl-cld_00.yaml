- en: 'There has been a significant buzz surrounding the world of serverless and the
    vast potential it brings to a new generation of developers. In *Hands-On Serverless
    Computing with Google Cloud*, we focus on the three serverless platforms offered
    by Google Cloud: App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run. Each section will
    provide a high-level introduction to the product and outline the main attributes
    of each technology. At the end of the book, two case studies are presented to
    illustrate the power of serverless. The aim of these case studies is to demonstrate
    how to manage serverless workloads on Google Cloud.'

    provides a high-level overview of App Engine, the first serverless platform released
    by Google back in 2008 (yes, over a decade ago). The chapter provides you with
    an understanding of what App Engine is, before going into the details of the supporting
    components.'

    Engine*, gives you an overview of what is possible with App Engine. In this chapter,
    we illustrate the critical elements of the platform to show how easy it is to
    have even the most basic application effortlessly achieve scale and resilience
    without requiring additional maintenance.'

    Functions*, discusses the value of moving to functions that have a single purpose.
    Reducing the size of an application footprint makes it easier to debug and run
    against a workload. During this chapter, we also introduce the concept of Google
    Cloud Functions, which take this concept to deliver serverless workloads on Google
    Cloud.'

    Functions*, introduces the topic of using Cloud Functions on Google Cloud. In
    this chapter, we focus on the critical elements of how to build, deploy, and maintain
    serverless apps. To supplement this chapter, we discuss the Functions Framework,
    which enables local development to simulate the cloud, and cover the HTTP protocol
    for new web developers.'

    as a Service*, works through a series of examples to build a service. In this
    chapter, we start to utilize Google APIs and various resources to integrate with
    our Cloud Functions. During this chapter, we see how event processing can minimize
    the development of code.'

    In this second example, we learn how to build multiple services for a proof of
    concept application. The application demonstrates several techniques and how to
    integrate services such as Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Build, and Container Registry.
    By the end of the exercise, you will have experience of how to consume JSON and
    build a scalable solution around data management and propagation.'
