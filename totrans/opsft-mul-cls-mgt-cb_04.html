			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>OpenShift Personas and Skillsets</h1>
			<p>Now that you understand what an OpenShift cluster architecture looks like, what about understanding the people that work with it? I have seen in my career many adoptions of different software, platforms, and processes, some of them running smoothly and others being challenging. What are the differences between them that define good or bad adoption? The main difference is the people – that is, how people are treated in the process is crucial to determining good adoption. </p>
			<p>We strongly believe that you need to care about people as much as you care about the platform itself. Because of that, we decided to reserve some pages of this book to discuss the main personas and skills usually needed to perform <span class="No-Break">activities well.</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, you will find in this chapter <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some of the personas that are related <span class="No-Break">to OpenShift</span></li>
				<li>The key responsibilities and duties that are usually required for <span class="No-Break">those personas</span></li>
				<li>The challenges they <span class="No-Break">usually face</span></li>
				<li>What they usually expect to see in a <span class="No-Break">container platform</span></li>
				<li>A skills matrix containing the main abilities that a resource needs <span class="No-Break">to have</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following are the main topics covered in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Personas</span></li>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">skills matrix</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's <span class="No-Break">dive in!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Personas</h1>
			<p>We are going <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>to discuss in this section the professional roles (<strong class="bold">personas</strong>) that we <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>have usually worked with in our career dealing with OpenShift and that, in general, are related to OpenShift on <span class="No-Break">some level.</span></p>
			<p>In the following figure, you will see some of the typical roles from an <span class="No-Break">IT department:</span></p>

			<p>Let's review some of the main technical roles and learn useful information that will allow us to better prepare an organization for OpenShift adoption. If you work in a coordinator role, take this opportunity to learn what you should expect from your technical team; if you are an individual contributor, learn what the activities and skills are that you will probably need to handle on a daily basis. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>A system/cloud/platform administrator</h2>
			<p>A system, cloud, or platform administrator is an individual contributor who is responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>for maintaining the underlying <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>infrastructure of the OpenShift clusters and also the clusters themselves. Depending on the scale of an organization, there are multiple specializations in this role, such as network, operating system, and <span class="No-Break">storage administration.</span></p>
			<p>Let's look at some of the duties they need to perform and the challenges they face while <span class="No-Break">doing so.</span></p>
			<h3>Key responsibilities and duties</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Support <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>the network, storage, and virtualization layers and the <span class="No-Break">underlying infrastructure.</span></li>
				<li>OpenShift cluster administrative operations, such as scale nodes, upgrades, and granting permissions to users <span class="No-Break">and groups.</span></li>
				<li>Configure OpenShift namespaces, network policies, resource quotas, node selectors, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
				<li>Platform <span class="No-Break">capacity management.</span></li>
				<li>Cloud cost estimation <span class="No-Break">and reporting.</span></li>
				<li>Open support tickets with vendors to get assistance to deal with issues related to the clusters' underlying infrastructure <span class="No-Break">and/or OpenShift.</span></li>
				<li>Monitor the platform performance <span class="No-Break">and stability.</span></li>
				<li>Analyze and report incidents proactively when noticing <span class="No-Break">possible issues.</span></li>
				<li>Respond to users <span class="No-Break">about incidents.</span></li>
				<li>Collect logs to <span class="No-Break">investigate issues.</span></li>
				<li>Report <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>metrics about operations, such as the <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>number of incidents, <strong class="bold">Mean Time to Recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">MTTR</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Mean Time Between </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Failures</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MTBF</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The challenges they face (usually)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standards</strong>: As clusters <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage them mainly due to the lack of standards <span class="No-Break">to use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Observability</strong>: Organizations that struggle to establish comprehensive and efficient application and infrastructure monitoring are not uncommon, unfortunately. Inefficient monitoring tools and practices make it much more difficult to make the right decisions. Administrators have difficulties in establishing tools and practices to observe <span class="No-Break">environments properly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Capacity planning and management</strong>: Cluster administrators often have challenges with correctly managing the cluster's capacity. It is not an unusual situation where clusters run out of resources due to a lack of monitoring and <span class="No-Break">capacity planning.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud cost</strong>: As cloud usage grows, keeping costs under control also becomes <span class="No-Break">more difficult.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Supporting multiple cloud environments</strong>: Administrators often need to deal with and support multiple cloud environments, which makes administration and management much <span class="No-Break">more challenging.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging management</strong>: Some companies struggle to define and maintain an efficient logging platform for containers, which impacts issue analysis, root-cause detection of a problem, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support tickets</strong>: It is common to have difficulties managing support tickets from vendors, sometimes due to lack of knowledge of how to collect logs and other things, such as insufficient information for a vendor to review, or <span class="No-Break">vendor delay.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What do they want to see on a container platform?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A mature <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> enterprise container orchestrator platform to host the applications developed by the <span class="No-Break">development teams.</span></li>
				<li>Vendors that can provide a great support experience and establish themselves as trusted <span class="No-Break">advisor partners.</span></li>
				<li>A platform that is compatible with different infrastructure and/or <span class="No-Break">cloud vendors.</span></li>
				<li>If there is a monitoring and/or logging tool in place, the platform needs to be able to integrate with it. If there isn't, the platform needs to have an out-of-the-box logging and <span class="No-Break">monitoring tool.</span></li>
				<li>A platform with available GitOps tools, such as <span class="No-Break">Argo CD.</span></li>
				<li>Monitoring tools and dashboards that can assist in the capacity planning and management of <span class="No-Break">the clusters.</span></li>
				<li>A platform with a high level of automation out of the box and/or can easily be automated using tools such as Ansible <span class="No-Break">or Terraform.</span></li>
				<li>A complete product documentation and knowledge <span class="No-Break">base available.</span></li>
				<li>Great training that is available from vendors <span class="No-Break">or partners.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next persona that usually has a tight relationship with OpenShift is the IT architect. Let's take a look at it <span class="No-Break">closely now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>IT architect</h2>
			<p>An IT architect, in the <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>context of OpenShift, is an individual contributor <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>who is responsible for designing the high-level architecture and definitions for one or more clusters. Architects collect business requirements and understand issues, problems, and other references to define a solution that best addresses them. There are several different architect roles, which change from company to company, but some usual ones are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application architects</strong>: Design <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>and supervise <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>the development and release of applications and related <span class="No-Break">technical tasks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Solution architects</strong>: In <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>general, architects <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>with strong technical but also management knowledge who lead <span class="No-Break">entire projects.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enterprise architects</strong>: An <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>architect <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>who works with the business to define the whole IT strategy for <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure/cloud architects</strong>: Design <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>and supervise projects on cloud providers or <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>on-premises hardware <span class="No-Break">and infrastructure.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The architect role described as follows is closer to an infrastructure/cloud architect, who generally will work much closer with OpenShift than <span class="No-Break">the others.</span></p>
			<h3>Key responsibilities and duties</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Work <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>with the business to get the requirements for a container <span class="No-Break">orchestration platform.</span></li>
				<li>Plan and design the cluster architecture, considering the business requirements and best practices such as high availability, security, and other important aspects for any <span class="No-Break">critical platform.</span></li>
				<li>Estimate sizes to handle the initial <span class="No-Break">required capacity.</span></li>
				<li>Estimate the effort to deploy and support <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
				<li>Estimate the initial and ongoing cost of <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
				<li>Assist the director and others at the VP level on the <span class="No-Break">platform-buying decision.</span></li>
				<li>Design a monitoring and logging solution for <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
				<li>Define security requirements for <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></li>
				<li>Define the ongoing policies and process requirements, such as backup and <span class="No-Break">disaster recovery.</span></li>
				<li>Assist <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>the DevOps engineer to define <strong class="bold">Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) processes and pipelines using the <span class="No-Break">container platform.</span></li>
				<li>Hand <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>over the decisions and specifications to the development and operations teams. Assist in deployment and <span class="No-Break">platform usage.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The challenges they face (usually)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>: I have <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>seen many times IT architects that were pushed to design architecture for an OpenShift cluster without knowing sometimes even the basic concepts about it. They are used to designing architectures for applications in other less complex systems and not for a platform such as Kubernetes or OpenShift, in which you need to deal with a wide range of aspects such as virtualization, storage, <span class="No-Break">and network.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of sponsorship</strong>: Architects usually need to get information and engage people from different teams inside an organization to understand and define some aspects of the architecture – for example, which storage options they have available to use with the platform, which network characteristics will be used, and so on. When they don't have proper sponsorship to engage the right people, the architecture design usually is time-consuming <span class="No-Break">and frustrating.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Requirement definitions</strong>: It is not uncommon for organizations to not have a clear definition of what the requirements for the platform are. Some companies don't even know what they want to achieve with the platform and decide to adopt the technology just because some competitors are using it, or other similar reasons. That makes the architectural definition a much harder task, as it is difficult to be assertive and accurate with the decisions that need to be made in <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vendor assistance</strong>: Architects need a lot of assistance from the vendor during the <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>platform's architectural design. Engaging with the vendor sometimes is challenging, due to a lack of availability, a delay in replying to information, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What do they want to see on a container platform?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A mature <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/> enterprise container orchestrator platform to host the applications developed by the <span class="No-Break">development teams</span></li>
				<li>Vendors that can meet service-level agreements <span class="No-Break">for support</span></li>
				<li>Trusted advisor vendors that can assist with information, demonstrations, and proof <span class="No-Break">of concepts</span></li>
				<li>A platform that is compatible with the infrastructure and/or cloud vendors defined by <span class="No-Break">the business</span></li>
				<li>A platform <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>that can integrate with existing tools, such as <strong class="bold">Application Performance Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">APM</strong>), monitoring, <span class="No-Break">and logging</span></li>
				<li>A comprehensive platform that includes monitoring, logging, CI/CD, service mesh, and <span class="No-Break">serverless tools.</span></li>
				<li>GitOps tools available out of <span class="No-Break">the box</span></li>
				<li>An ecosystem that includes IDE plugins, samples, and other <span class="No-Break">development tools</span></li>
				<li>A platform with a high level of automation out of the box and/or can easily be automated using tools such as Ansible <span class="No-Break">or Terraform</span></li>
				<li>A central management solution for <span class="No-Break">multiple clusters</span></li>
				<li>A complete product documentation and knowledge <span class="No-Break">base available</span></li>
				<li>Great training that is available from vendors <span class="No-Break">or partners</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A really important piece of this puzzle is the application developer; without them, there is no application to host on any platform! Let's take a look at the <span class="No-Break">role now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Application developer</h2>
			<p>A developer is <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>an individual contributor who uses a container <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>platform to build and deploy application code. In some companies, the application developer has direct access to the container platform to perform basic actions on it, such <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>as deployment and configuration of the application in development and/or <strong class="bold">Quality Assurance</strong> (<strong class="bold">QA</strong>) environments; in other companies, they only have access to a CI/CD system to run a pipeline to check and deploy <span class="No-Break">code automatically.</span></p>
			<h3>Key responsibilities and duties</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>functional requirements, use cases, or user stories to develop and <span class="No-Break">test code.</span></li>
				<li>Develop code <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>using best practices such as <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>), CI, Infrastructure as Code, <span class="No-Break">and GitOps.</span></li>
				<li>Commit <span class="No-Break">code frequently.</span></li>
				<li>Develop and run <span class="No-Break">unit tests.</span></li>
				<li>Build the <span class="No-Break">container application.</span></li>
				<li>Support QA teams to test <span class="No-Break">an application.</span></li>
				<li>Bug-fixing of <span class="No-Break">production issues.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The challenges they face (usually)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>: Usually, organizations don't give the appropriate concern to a developer's <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>platform knowledge. They are well educated with code languages, frameworks, IDEs, and related subjects but not about the platform that will host the application – in this case, OpenShift. That is a frequent cause of rework in order to adapt the code to specific <span class="No-Break">platform requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proper permissions</strong>: It is not uncommon that developers don't have proper permission with a container platform to perform their duties. This impacts their performance and <span class="No-Break">generates frustration.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proper processes and tools</strong>: Some developers don't have the proper tools and processes <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>available to perform activities by themselves. Usually, they depend on other teams to get the proper IDE and runtimes installed, update the CI/CD pipeline to reflect a new change, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging management</strong>: In some companies, developers are not allowed to have direct access to logs; they need to request it from another team, and sometimes, that takes a long time, impacting <span class="No-Break">bug-fixing issues.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What do they want to see in a container platform?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>for the most <span class="No-Break">popular IDE</span></li>
				<li>A desktop development environment with tools to build and test <span class="No-Break">containerized applications</span></li>
				<li>Comprehensive samples with a wide range of software <span class="No-Break">development stacks</span></li>
				<li>Container base images with different supported runtimes (such as Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, <span class="No-Break">and Quarkus)</span></li>
				<li>Seamless integration with the <span class="No-Break">CI/CD tool</span></li>
				<li>The UI developer console, in which they can see the application logs, monitoring, <span class="No-Break">and configurations</span></li>
				<li>A complete product documentation and knowledge <span class="No-Break">base available</span></li>
				<li>Great training that is available from vendors <span class="No-Break">or partners</span></li>
				<li>A platform with proper permissions set that allows them to perform <span class="No-Break">their duties</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some more recent roles are also closely related with OpenShift such as the DevOps engineer and the <strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>). In the following section, you will learn more <span class="No-Break">about them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>The DevOps engineer/SRE</h2>
			<p>A DevOps engineer is <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>usually the individual contributor responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>for developing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to support development teams. They also analyze possible issues that occur with application build and deployments, using the CI/CD and container platform tools. This role can bring a lot of discussions, as DevOps itself is a culture and a set of practices to bring infrastructure and development together to be more agile and efficient, rather than a job role.  </p>
			<p>Similarly, an SRE is <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>usually the one that brings <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>some software engineering aspects to infrastructure to automate repetitive operational tasks and enables scalable and reliable environments. </p>
			<p>DevOps and SRE are tightly related – an SRE can be represented as one specific implementation of DevOps practices, usually focusing more on infrastructure and operational problems and implementations, while the DevOps engineer usually works more with the CI/CD process, supporting development teams to deliver code <span class="No-Break">more efficiently.</span></p>
			<p>We have decided to conflate both roles into one persona but adapt it to your real-world environment, and consider the following information to see which best fits your role in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h3>Key responsibilities and duties</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>CI/CD processes <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>and develop <span class="No-Break">pipelines accordingly.</span></li>
				<li>The continuous enhancement of CI/CD pipelines that support the <span class="No-Break">development teams.</span></li>
				<li>Define, build, and deploy standards for containers along with <span class="No-Break">CI/CD pipelines.</span></li>
				<li>Deploy and support tools used with CI/CD processes, such as Container Registry and the Git <span class="No-Break">versioning tool.</span></li>
				<li>Automate processes related to CI/CD (such as the DNS and load <span class="No-Break">balancer configurations).</span></li>
				<li>Support development teams regarding questions and issues concerning <span class="No-Break">CI/CD pipelines.</span></li>
				<li>Automate <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>repetitive operational tasks such as server provisioning and <span class="No-Break">network configurations.</span></li>
				<li>Define <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>and implement observability <span class="No-Break">of services.</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Capacity planning.</span></li>
				<li>Plan and run <span class="No-Break">chaos testing.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The challenges they face (usually)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>: DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>engineers <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>and SREs are also usually well educated with automation-related things but not always with the container platform and its <span class="No-Break">underlying infrastructure.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proper processes and tools</strong>: The best tools to develop a desired CI/CD, testing, and automation are not always available. In these situations, they are usually pushed to use workarounds, develop things with much more effort, and so on, which can be <span class="No-Break">really frustrating!</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform limitations</strong>: These professionals often need to automate processes with legacy systems that don't have APIs, which makes automation development much <span class="No-Break">more difficult.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What do they want to see in a container platform?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Easy <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>integration <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>with existing <span class="No-Break">CI/CD tools</span></li>
				<li>A UI console in which they can see the build and deployment logs and check the <span class="No-Break">deployment objects</span></li>
				<li>A high level of automation out of <span class="No-Break">the box</span></li>
				<li>A CLI and API that helps to automate <span class="No-Break">manual steps</span></li>
				<li>Plugins for CI/CD tools that facilitate <span class="No-Break">pipeline development</span></li>
				<li>An easy <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>way to deploy an application <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>over <span class="No-Break">multiple clusters</span></li>
				<li>Out-of-the-box observability or one that can be easily plugged into an <span class="No-Break">existing tool</span></li>
				<li>A platform that helps to implement perturbation models for <span class="No-Break">chaos testing</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, we have the security engineer, who is always important in any process, even more so now in the age of ransomware and other real security concerns. Let's check the following section to see how they are related <span class="No-Break">to OpenShift.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>The security engineers</h2>
			<p>The security engineer <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>is an individual contributor responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>for reviewing processes and tools that provide security for systems and data. They are always evaluating applications and systems to control environments from known threats, protect existing infrastructure to minimize vulnerabilities, and finally, detect and respond <span class="No-Break">against attackers.</span></p>
			<h3>Key responsibilities and duties</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Evaluate <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>possible platform vulnerabilities and create strategies to <span class="No-Break">mitigate them.</span></li>
				<li>Review CI/CD pipelines and add security gates to <span class="No-Break">maximize security.</span></li>
				<li>Establish a container image security scanning tool to detect any known vulnerability <span class="No-Break">within images.</span></li>
				<li>Define security policies to be used with <span class="No-Break">all clusters.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure that clusters are compliant with <span class="No-Break">defined policies.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The challenges they face (usually)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge</strong>: The security engineer <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> is no different from the previous roles. They usually have real concerns with OpenShift, mostly because they are not well educated with it and, as such, don't understand how security is implemented <span class="No-Break">in it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Secrets management</strong>: Management of passwords and sensitive data is still a challenge on Kubernetes. There are several vault systems available in the market already, but many companies still don't have a well-established practice and the tools to support it, which makes this a point of concern for <span class="No-Break">security teams.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Permissions management</strong>: It is a real challenge to define the right permissions level to ensure a secure platform that doesn't lock down developers and other teams, impacting <span class="No-Break">their productivity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vulnerability scan</strong>: Security tools for containers and Kubernetes are fairly recent, so most companies don't have any available, which can cause real nightmares for <span class="No-Break">security engineers!</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What do they want to see in a container platform?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A platform <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>that uses the most secure standards for container orchestration, such as Linux namespaces, <strong class="source-inline">cgroups</strong>, Linux capabilities, <strong class="source-inline">seccomp</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and SELinux</span></li>
				<li>A tool that allows them to easily define and enforce security policies among <span class="No-Break">several clusters</span></li>
				<li>A multi-tenant secure-capable platform that enables network isolation between <span class="No-Break">different workloads</span></li>
				<li>Data encryption <span class="No-Break">at rest</span></li>
				<li>A <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>secure <strong class="bold">Role-Based Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>) <span class="No-Break">platform available</span></li>
				<li>An audit log enabled <span class="No-Break">and logging</span></li>
				<li>Image registry with a <span class="No-Break">security scan</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>covered the different technical roles and their responsibilities, which will help you and your organization to be more prepared for OpenShift adoption. Finally, we will present a skills matrix that aims to help understand what the main skills required by each role are. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>The skills matrix</h1>
			<p>In this section, you will find a skills matrix suggested for the roles listed in the preceding sections. The items <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>listed here are a subset of technical skills that we have observed from experience as being important for a professional to know. Note that we are not covering soft skills in this book; this doesn't mean that we don't place any importance on soft skills – on the contrary, we do! – however, they are not the focus of this book. The skills <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>matrix is classified in the <span class="No-Break">following criteria:</span></p>
