- en: Organizations need to build a security culture to provide a suitable information-protection
    solution. In this chapter, you will get an overview of the four main pillars of
    security culture, which are leadership support, efficient training, ongoing testing,
    and continuous communication to the entire organization and its partners. If you
    don't establish a security culture, you will have difficulty being successful
    in every part of an information-protection strategy, because every employee needs
    to know what information needs to be protected. Furthermore, the introduction
    of security measures can result in high costs if they are not sufficiently planned
    and not supported by the management.

  zh: 组织需要建立安全文化，以提供合适的信息保护解决方案。在本章中，您将概述安全文化的四个主要支柱，它们分别是领导支持、有效培训、持续测试以及与整个组织及其合作伙伴的持续沟通。如果没有建立安全文化，您将很难在信息保护战略的各个环节中取得成功，因为每个员工都需要知道哪些信息需要被保护。此外，如果安全措施的引入没有得到充分规划且未获得管理层的支持，可能会导致高昂的成本。
- en: An additional focus in this chapter is data classification, as the classification
    of information provides the basis for most security mechanisms. The classification
    of information provides context for the factors that lead to security policies
    taking effect and triggering the right level of protection. Also, we will explain
    how applying the four main parts of a security culture leads to supporting the
    introduction of data classification. Finally, we will have our first contact with
    the Microsoft classification and protection solution to introduce the practical
    application in the following chapters.

- en: The ideas, duties, and behaviors of a group of people influence their security
    and can put them at risk, hence there is a need for security culture. In the professional
    world, security culture is used to describe the kinds of behaviors organizations
    would like to see in their employees in areas such as cyber, physical, and personal
    security. Security training and the change of the behavior of a co-worker to adapt
    to the safety guidelines of the enterprise are necessary. The main focus of a
    security culture is keeping infiltrators or other potentially damaging parties
    out. In our case, we will focus on the relevance to data security, because to
    handle the complete field of security goes beyond the scope and focus of this
    book. So, let's see what this means for us.

  zh: 一群人的思想、责任和行为会影响他们的安全，可能将他们置于风险之中，因此需要安全文化。在专业领域，安全文化用来描述组织希望在员工中看到的行为类型，涵盖网络安全、物理安全和个人安全等方面。安全培训和同事行为的改变，以适应企业的安全指南是必要的。安全文化的主要关注点是防止入侵者或其他潜在危害方的渗透。在我们的案例中，我们将重点关注数据安全相关性，因为处理完整的安全领域超出了本书的范围和重点。那么，让我们看看这对我们意味着什么。
- en: Digital transformation has reshaped the way we work. Data has become the new
    currency of business. Information such as development results, intended company
    acquisitions, sales account information, personal or financial data, and security
    information have very high values in organizations. A lot of the information and
    data created or exported from systems flows into and through organizations, out
    into the cloud, and across the Internet of Things. More and more data is in motion,
    and this creates more and more risk. This fact leads organizations to make extensive
    investments in data security, to protect their intellectual property and the trust
    of their customers.

  zh: 数字化转型已经重塑了我们的工作方式。数据已成为商业的新货币。诸如开发成果、拟定的公司收购、销售账户信息、个人或财务数据以及安全信息等信息在组织中具有非常高的价值。大量由系统创建或导出的信息和数据流入并通过组织，进入云端，穿越物联网。越来越多的数据在流动，这也带来了越来越多的风险。这个事实促使组织在数据安全上进行大量投资，以保护其知识产权和客户的信任。
- en: Technology alone doesn't solve the problems in the field of data security. Furthermore,
    if you think data security is only an IT task, you will remain vulnerable to breaches
    caused by user activity. Many security professionals still focus too much on processes
    and technology, or just on technology. This fact puts organizations in an unbalanced
    and weak position. We need to include all the employees in our strategy because
    if we don't, we leave the organization vulnerable to an attack factor that's nearly
    half of the current breaches in the actual cyber security world. In an enterprise,
    the elements, people, processes, and technology must be in harmony to create a
    strong foundation for a proper security culture, a successful data security strategy,
    and digital transformation.

  zh: 单靠技术并不能解决数据安全领域的问题。此外，如果你认为数据安全仅仅是IT的任务，那么你将继续受到用户行为引发的安全漏洞的威胁。许多安全专家仍然过于专注于流程和技术，或者仅仅关注技术。这种情况使得组织处于一种不平衡且脆弱的状态。我们需要将所有员工纳入我们的战略之中，因为如果不这样做，我们将使组织面临当前网络安全世界中近一半的安全漏洞的攻击因素。在企业中，元素、人员、流程和技术必须保持和谐，才能为正确的安全文化、成功的数据安全战略和数字化转型奠定坚实的基础。
- en: In organizations with a proper security culture, employees have a clear understanding
    about what is right and wrong, the type of activity they should report, and how
    to contact the right team. On the other hand, in organizations with a weak security
    culture, security becomes someone else's responsibility. A vital fact of an effective
    security culture is to have a shared sense of ownership.

- en: So, it's quite important to understand that you need to engage and educate employees
    to make better decisions on how information is handled. By prompting your users
    to pause and consider the business value of the information they own and control,
    you're empowering them to use it in a way that won't put your corporate data at

- en: Already during the creation of information, or when saving, the employee is
    supposed to categorize the information correctly and to trigger the right protection. Besides,
    the employee learns to better assess the need for security and the value of the
    information for the company in the future, as well as to adapt their handling
    of sensitive content to the organizational guidelines. The data classification
    additionally provides the factors that are essential for security reports. It

    measures. Let's start with a basic definition of data classification. It is a
    continuous process of consistently categorizing information based on specific
    and predefined criteria so that the data can be efficiently verified, effectively
    identified, and protected. This is why data classification is the foundation of

- en: Successful data classification requires a broad awareness of the needs of an
    organization and a thorough understanding of where the data assets are located
    and how data or information is generated. For this reason, finding and identifying
    existing data on various endpoints, such as network shares, databases, or cloud
    services, is closely tied to classification. Even when creating new data, classification
    is always carried out.

  zh: 成功的数据分类需要广泛的组织需求意识，并深入理解数据资产的存储位置以及数据或信息的生成方式。因此，查找和识别各种终端上的现有数据（例如网络共享、数据库或云服务）与分类密切相关。即使是在创建新数据时，分类也始终会进行。
- en: 'In addition to the different endpoints at which data is usually available,
    there are three basic states in which data can be located: in idle mode, during
    processing, and during transport. All three states require technical solutions
    for data classification. However, the principles used are the same for all three
    states. Unfortunately, data classification must always be done in the creation
    process. For example, confidential data about all the three states must be treated
    confidentially. Furthermore, a distinction has to be made between structured and
    unstructured data. In typical classification processes, structured data in databases
    or tables is less complicated than unstructured data such as documents, source
    code, or email messages.'

  zh: 除了数据通常存在的不同终端外，数据可以处于三种基本状态：空闲状态、处理状态和传输状态。这三种状态都需要数据分类的技术解决方案。然而，使用的原则对于这三种状态是相同的。不幸的是，数据分类必须在创建过程中进行。例如，关于所有三种状态的机密数据必须以机密方式处理。此外，还需要区分结构化数据和非结构化数据。在典型的分类过程中，数据库或表格中的结构化数据比文档、源代码或电子邮件等非结构化数据更为简单。

    projects fail or get stuck because of classification schemes that are too complex.
    The data-classification schema provides different labels to apply the classification
    to the information. For example, the Confidential label is used for sensitive
    information that should not be accessible by unauthorized users. Often, we find
    concepts that use labels the users are not able to understand, or labels that
    conflict with other labels. Consequently, it is advisable to start an iterative

    remain unarchived because they are not recognized as requiring archiving by the
    system or process. An example of this is the many contract-relevant files that
    end up in the filesystem. In particular, the large stocks of data on file servers
    represent a black box for many companies, in which the relevance for specific
    compliance issues is only partially known. Through the automated classification
    of all files in the company, relevant information is recognized and archived by
    the classification. Through the cross-company approach and automation, a significantly

    limitations in the product. With other vendors, such as TITUS, you can fill the
    gaps and provide a suitable solution. You can find more information at [https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq](https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq).

- en: In this chapter, we learned why you need to have a security culture in an organization,
    and how it relates to and is supported by an information protection strategy.
    Then, we discussed what data classification means and why it builds the foundation
    of every data security solution. During the general overview of data classification,
    we looked at the relevance of a data classification scheme and related policies.
    Finally, we saw a Microsoft AIP solution overview, which builds the technology
    base for the information-protection solution we'll create in the coming chapters.
    Using the knowledge you gained in this chapter, you'll be able to define your
    own classification schemes, rules, and policies. Furthermore, you know which areas
    are critical in a security culture and you can include the appropriate tasks into
    your projects.
