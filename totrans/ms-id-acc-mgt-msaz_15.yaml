    solution. In this chapter, you will get an overview of the four main pillars of
    security culture, which are leadership support, efficient training, ongoing testing,
    and continuous communication to the entire organization and its partners. If you
    don't establish a security culture, you will have difficulty being successful
    in every part of an information-protection strategy, because every employee needs
    to know what information needs to be protected. Furthermore, the introduction
    of security measures can result in high costs if they are not sufficiently planned
    and not supported by the management.

    taking effect and triggering the right level of protection. Also, we will explain
    how applying the four main parts of a security culture leads to supporting the
    introduction of data classification. Finally, we will have our first contact with
    the Microsoft classification and protection solution to introduce the practical

    and can put them at risk, hence there is a need for security culture. In the professional
    world, security culture is used to describe the kinds of behaviors organizations
    would like to see in their employees in areas such as cyber, physical, and personal
    security. Security training and the change of the behavior of a co-worker to adapt
    to the safety guidelines of the enterprise are necessary. The main focus of a
    security culture is keeping infiltrators or other potentially damaging parties
    out. In our case, we will focus on the relevance to data security, because to
    handle the complete field of security goes beyond the scope and focus of this
    book. So, let's see what this means for us.

    currency of business. Information such as development results, intended company
    acquisitions, sales account information, personal or financial data, and security
    information have very high values in organizations. A lot of the information and
    data created or exported from systems flows into and through organizations, out
    into the cloud, and across the Internet of Things. More and more data is in motion,
    and this creates more and more risk. This fact leads organizations to make extensive
    investments in data security, to protect their intellectual property and the trust
    of their customers.

    if you think data security is only an IT task, you will remain vulnerable to breaches
    caused by user activity. Many security professionals still focus too much on processes
    and technology, or just on technology. This fact puts organizations in an unbalanced
    and weak position. We need to include all the employees in our strategy because
    if we don't, we leave the organization vulnerable to an attack factor that's nearly
    half of the current breaches in the actual cyber security world. In an enterprise,
    the elements, people, processes, and technology must be in harmony to create a
    strong foundation for a proper security culture, a successful data security strategy,
    and digital transformation.

    about what is right and wrong, the type of activity they should report, and how
    to contact the right team. On the other hand, in organizations with a weak security
    culture, security becomes someone else's responsibility. A vital fact of an effective
    security culture is to have a shared sense of ownership.

    to pause and consider the business value of the information they own and control,
    you're empowering them to use it in a way that won't put your corporate data at
    risk. The use of data classification enables employees to handle sensitive content

    supposed to categorize the information correctly and to trigger the right protection. Besides,
    the employee learns to better assess the need for security and the value of the
    information for the company in the future, as well as to adapt their handling
    of sensitive content to the organizational guidelines. The data classification
    additionally provides the factors that are essential for security reports. It
    will also trigger the execution of security functions at the right time to keep
    the business in a secure state.

- en: After we describe the necessity and the four central elements of the security
    culture, we will discuss the data classification to create the basis for a successful
    solution in the area of information protection. As already mentioned, data classification
    provides the necessary information and tools for the correct use of protective
    measures. Let's start with a basic definition of data classification. It is a
    continuous process of consistently categorizing information based on specific
    and predefined criteria so that the data can be efficiently verified, effectively
    identified, and protected. This is why data classification is the foundation of
    data security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Successful data classification requires a broad awareness of the needs of an
    organization and a thorough understanding of where the data assets are located
    and how data or information is generated. For this reason, finding and identifying
    existing data on various endpoints, such as network shares, databases, or cloud
    services, is closely tied to classification. Even when creating new data, classification
    is always carried out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In addition to the different endpoints at which data is usually available,
    there are three basic states in which data can be located: in idle mode, during
    processing, and during transport. All three states require technical solutions
    for data classification. However, the principles used are the same for all three
    states. Unfortunately, data classification must always be done in the creation
    process. For example, confidential data about all the three states must be treated
    confidentially. Furthermore, a distinction has to be made between structured and
    unstructured data. In typical classification processes, structured data in databases
    or tables is less complicated than unstructured data such as documents, source
    code, or email messages.'

    sensitivity level. A correct implementation of a data-classification solution
    leads to the creation of sensitive and confidential data with proper foresight.
    It can be decided whether information can be made publicly available or not.

    The data-classification schema provides different labels to apply the classification

    information that should not be accessible by unauthorized users. Often, we find
    concepts that use labels the users are not able to understand, or labels that
    conflict with other labels. Consequently, it is advisable to start an iterative
    process and only with the necessary options.'

    end up in the filesystem. In particular, the large stocks of data on file servers
    represent a black box for many companies, in which the relevance for specific
    compliance issues is only partially known. Through the automated classification
    of all files in the company, relevant information is recognized and archived by
    the classification. Through the cross-company approach and automation, a significantly
    higher degree of completeness is achieved here.

- en: Hierarchical storage management or tiered storage is the optimization of storage
    costs by using different performance levels to reduce the use of expensive storage
    systems. Files are moved from the cost-intensive systems to the lower-cost system
    according to different selection criteria, without users or applications noticing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional solutions typically work exclusively with technical attributes,
    such as file type or age, to decide on the ability of a file to migrate to less
    expensive storage. They usually provide too rough a grid of selection criteria
    to be really efficient in practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of a suitable
    approach to get information about the swap capabilities of file stocks from the
    trade pages.
  prefs: []

- en: The professional classification of the file and the assignment of document classes,
    such as an invoice, employment contract, or construction plan, provide a better
    way to formulate outsourcing rules. Furthermore, these rules are entirely independent
    of the actual structures on the file servers and therefore much easier in administration.
  prefs: []

    files based on their value to the business.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Previous mechanisms for access protection were based on filing structures such
    as folders and shares. Thus, different views cannot be displayed. There is a conflict
    between high administrative effort on the one hand and uncontested need for protection
    on the other. Also, this method is entirely dependent on the correct behavior
    of users; if they misplace information, the information is visible to unauthorized
    people. Ultimately, files are therefore insufficiently protected today.

    can be helpful, we will discuss the related information about the relationship

- en: In terms of data classification and subsequent information protection, the authentication
    of a user is upstream. Authentication of a user typically consists of two parts—the
    username or ID to identify the user, and a password to confirm that the user's
    credentials are valid. Authentication does not provide the user with access to
    information or services. It is just a verification that the user is who they claim
    to be.

    of giving an authenticated user the ability to access an application or information.
    Assigning the rights assigned to an authenticated user to access the information
    requires attention to data classification. Due to the upstream authentication,
    it is necessary to gain a better insight into which sensitive data is affected

    Architecture (information protection). You can learn more about the cyber security
    architecture of Microsoft at [https://bit.ly/2Sh1zN2](https://bit.ly/2Sh1zN2).

    limitations in the product. With other vendors, such as TITUS, you can fill the
    gaps and provide a suitable solution. You can find more information at [https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq](https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq).

- en: In this chapter, we learned why you need to have a security culture in an organization,
    and how it relates to and is supported by an information protection strategy.
    Then, we discussed what data classification means and why it builds the foundation
    of every data security solution. During the general overview of data classification,
    we looked at the relevance of a data classification scheme and related policies.
    Finally, we saw a Microsoft AIP solution overview, which builds the technology
    base for the information-protection solution we'll create in the coming chapters.
    Using the knowledge you gained in this chapter, you'll be able to define your
    own classification schemes, rules, and policies. Furthermore, you know which areas
    are critical in a security culture and you can include the appropriate tasks into
    your projects.
