    is especially true in the Azure ecosystem, where we're given multiple tools and
    shortcuts when provisioning resources, configuring services, and developing applications.
    This chapter will show the reader how to enhance productivity even more, and shorten
    the time needed to deliver a working solution.

    changing its configuration, or finding a particular value, is indeed one of the
    easiest ways of managing both your subscription and deployed services. However,
    it may become cumbersome when you have tens or hundreds of different subscriptions,
    resource groups, and instances. In such scenarios, it is always better to have
    access to scripts and commands that speed things up and allow for automation,
    if needed. In this section, we will cover two basic tools available in Azure:
    the Azure CLI and Cloud Shell, which you can use when just the portal is not enough.'

    However, when you have hundreds of resources provisioned, mistakes may happen—you
    can accidentally move, rename, or even delete a resource, which should not even be
    touched. To prevent such scenarios, it is possible to use locks—a simple feature
    that stops you from performing a forbidden action. In this section, you will learn

    service, but rather extending your current knowledge, and allowing you to become
    a better user, developer, and architect of solutions based on Microsoft Azure.
    You have learned how to use the Azure CLI and Cloud Shell to ease management operations,
    how to leverage locks to secure all fragile resources, and how to read an Azure
    service configuration. We also discussed the pros for adopting proper naming conventions
    and how they affect your applications deployed in Azure. This was an exciting
    journey through the Azure cloud, where you discovered many different PaaS offerings
    from this particular platform. Azure is a fantastic ecosystem and allows you to
    build both small web pages and complex, enterprise-level platforms. What is more,
    it is also incredibly dynamic—this is why I strongly encourage you to take a look
    at the *Further reading*sections detailed in this book, so you can get more experience
    with it and become familiar with the more advanced concepts. The important thing
    here is also to constantly update your knowledge, whether through reading blogs,
    going to meetups, or conferences, and of course reading articles and books. As
    cloud computing is one of the major topics in recent years when it comes to software
    development, it is crucial to become familiar with it and build your skill set,
    which you can use in your daily work.
