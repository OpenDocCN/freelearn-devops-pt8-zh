<p>In the previous chapter, we've covered how to manage <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> (<strong>Azure AD</strong>). This chapter proceeds with the <em>Managing Identities</em><span> </span>objective<em>.</em><span> </span>In this chapter, we are going to cover how to implement and manage hybrid identities. We are going to install and configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize the identities from your <span>on-premises A</span>ctive Directory to Azure AD. Then you will learn how to manage Azure AD Connect. In the last part of this chapter, we will dive into <span>password sync and password </span>writeback. You will learn how to enable password sync in Azure AD Connect and the Azure portal. At lastly, you will learn how to manage password sync.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Azure AD Connect</span></li>
<li>Installing Azure AD Connect</li>
<li>Managing Azure AD Connect</li>
<li>Managing password sync and password writeback</li>

<p>Azure AD Connect is a service that you can use to synchronize your on-premises Active Directory identities with Azure. This way, you can use the same identities for authentication on your on-premises environment as well as in the cloud, and other <strong>software as a service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The Azure AD Connect sync service consists of two parts, the Azure AD Connect sync component, which is a tool that is installed on a separate server inside your on-premises environment, and the Azure AD Connect sync service, which is part of Azure AD. The sync component can sync data from Active Directory and SQL Servers to Azure. There is also a third component named the <strong>Active Directory Federation Services</strong> (<strong>ADFS</strong>) component, which can be used in a scenario where ADFS is involved. To monitor the on-premises identity infrastructure and the different Azure AD components, you can use a tool named Azure AD Connect Health. The following diagram illustrates the <span>architecture of </span>Azure AD Connect:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Azure AD Connect architecture</div>
<p>Azure AD Connect offers support for your users to sign in with the same passwords to both on-premises and cloud resources. It provides three different authentication methods for this, the password hash synchronization method, the pass-through authentication method, and the Federated SSO method (in conjunction with ADFS).</p>

<p>Most organizations only have a requirement to enable user sign in to Office 365, SaaS applications, and other Azure AD-based resources. The password hash synchronization method is well suitable for those scenarios.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Using this method, hashes of the user's password are synced between the on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. When there are any changes to the user's password, the password is synced immediately, so users can always log in with the same credentials on-premises as well as in Azure.</p>
<p>This authentication method also provides Azure AD Seamless <strong>Single Sign-On</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>). This way, users are automatically signed in when they are using a domain-joined device on the corporate network. Users only have to enter their username when using Seamless SSO. To use Seamless SSO, you don't have to install additional software or components on the on-premises network. You can push this capability to your users using group policies.</p>

<p>Azure AD pass-through authentication offers the same capability as Azure AD password hash synchronization. Users can log in to their Azure resources as well as on-premises resources using the same credentials. The difference is that the passwords don't sync with Azure AD using pass-through authentication. The passwords are validated using the on-premises Active Directory and are not stored in the Azure AD at all.</p>
<p>This method is suitable for organizations that have security and compliance restrictions and aren't allowed to send usernames and passwords outside the on-premises network. Pass-through authentication requires an agent to be installed on a domain-joined Windows server that resides inside the on-premises environment. This agent then listens for password validation requests and only makes an outbound connection from within your network. It also offers support for <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>) and Azure AD conditional access policies.</p>
<p>Azure AD pass-through authentication offers Azure AD Seamless SSO as well.</p>
<p>In the next section, we are going to install Azure AD Connect and synchronize some on-premises users to Azure.</p>

<p>Azure AD Connect is installed on an on-premises server with Active Directory installed and configured on it. The first step is to download Azure AD Connect. After downloading, we can install it on a domain controller.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For this demonstration, I have already deployed a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine in Azure and installed and configured Active Directory on it. Configuring Active Directory is beyond the scope of the exam and this book. Make sure that when you configure Active Directory Domain Services, the Forest name matches one of the existing verified custom domains in Azure AD. Otherwise, you will receive a warning message when you install Azure AD Connect on your domain controller, that SSO is not enabled for your users. For installing Active Directory on a Windows Server 2016 machine, you can refer to the following website: <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2017/02/22/step-by-step-setting-up-active-directory-in-windows-server-2016/">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2017/02/22/step-by-step-setting-up-active-directory-in-windows-server-2016/</a>.</div>
<p>Therefore, take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before downloading Azure AD Connect, add at least one user to your on-premises Active Directory.</li>

<p>Password writeback is used for <span>synchronizing password changes in Azure AD back to your on-premises Active Directory environment. This setting is enabled as part of Azure AD Connect, and it provides a secure mechanism to send password changes from Azure AD back to an on-premises Active Directory. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>It provides the following features and capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforcement of on-premises Active Directory password policies</strong><span>: </span>When a user resets their password, the on-premises Active Directory policy is checked to ensure it meets the password requirements before it gets committed to the directory. It checks the password complexity, history, password filters, age, and other password restrictions that are defined in the on-premises Active Directory.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-delay feedback</strong><span>: Users are notified immediately after changing their password, if their password doesn't meet the on-premises Active Directory policy requirements. This is a synchronous operation.</span></li>
<li><strong>Supports password<span> </span>writeback<span> </span>when an administrator resets them from the Azure portal</strong><span>: When an administrator resets the password in the Azure portal, the password is written back to the on-premises Active Directory (when a user is federated or password hash synchronized). This functionality doesn't work from the Office admin portal.</span></li>
<li><strong>Doesn't require any inbound firewall rules</strong><span>: </span>Password writeback uses the Azure Service Bus for communicating with the on-premises Active Directory, so there is no need to open the firewall. All communication is outbound and goes over port <kbd>443</kbd>.</li>
<li><strong>Supports password changes from the access panel and Office 365</strong><span>: When federated or password hash synchronized users change their password, those passwords are written back to your on-premises Active Directory as well.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next demonstration, we are going to enable password writeback.</p>
