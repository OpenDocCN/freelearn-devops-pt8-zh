- en: '**Continuous integration** (**CI**) is the practice of using automated tools
    to compile automatically and continuously, based on changes made by developers
    to source code, and packaging and testing them to ensure they are stable and able
    to provide the expected functionality.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Continuous delivery** (**CD**) uses the artifacts created via CI and deploys
    those applications without human intervention to end users, ensuring these are
    always updated with the latest versions and, in most cases, performing additional
    verifications in multiple environments before reaching the final end users.'

- en: All of this is possible by taking advantage of Azure Pipelines, one of the leading
    platforms to support all aspects of the **software development life cycle** (**SDLC**);
    however, in this book, we will focus on the CI/CD aspects and how to take advantage
    of the features available to effect the different task automation options under
    the DevOps umbrella, even touching on the DevSecOps aspects.

    basic concepts and building from there to more complex scenarios. This will lead
    to end-to-end scenarios that enable your software development teams with the tools
    to automate, every step of the way, the delivery of applications, from source
    code to a running platform.
