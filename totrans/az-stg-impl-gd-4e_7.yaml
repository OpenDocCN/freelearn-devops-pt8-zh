    you need to, so you don't need to put oversized resources into play. The organization
    also missed the routers and firewalls and didn't take into account VM scale sets,

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be variable, so you need to consider business requirements when choosing between
    them. We'll go into detail about both models in the following sections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consumption-based model
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The consumption-based, or pay-as-you-go, model follows a utility-based structure.
    This means that you pay for what you use and there is no monthly or fixed cost
    for the resources. An example of this would be a function application, where you'd
    pay one dollar for a million uses of the app.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This pay-for-what-you-use model can help you control costs, but could also potentially
    increase them. An example of this might be something like CosmosDB, which is based
    on usage or request units and can become very costly at the end of the day depending
    on how many times queries are run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    We already mentioned Azure reservations and specifically RIs, but another example
    would be an App Service plan in Azure. When you select a type of resource you
    incur a monthly cost, and regardless of how many people utilize the application,
    you still pay this cost. This costing model helps organizations predict their
    spending in Azure a little better, but it can also be a problem based on utilization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations buy reserved instances when they plan to make extensive use of
    VMs for their applications. In return for committing to resources for fixed terms,
    Azure can provide them at discounted rates. When you first migrate to the cloud,
    there may be uncertainty around your resource usage, so depending on your workloads,
    it may be best to get a handle on this before you consider RIs.

    waste, mismanaged resources, and right-sized resources, and also by reserving
    capacity. With cost management being one of the five principles of cloud governance,
    it is important to focus on ways of establishing a spending plan and budget for
    your cloud resources. You will also want to use monitoring and alerting to enforce
    these budgets and detect anomalies that emerge from development practices. Microsoft
    provides the Cloud Adoption Framework for guidance on this, which details tools,
    best practices, and documentation to help organizations succeed in the cloud.

- en: A general method for estimating cost and making changes to the pricing models
    we discussed earlier is by monitoring your workloads on a peak throughput. For
    example, if the utilization is high all the time, a pay-as-you-go model would
    be less efficient for baseline cost estimation. Hence, while providing flexibility,
    the pay-as-you-go model alone doesn't always constitute a cost-saving.

- en: With Azure, there is a distinct cost difference between on-premises datacenters
    and virtualizing those datacenters in the cloud. We reviewed some of the ways
    to approach these costs and cost models in Azure. We talked about the unique benefits
    of adopting Azure, including the ability to span to the cloud with hybrid models
    for workloads that don't entirely need to run in the cloud. We have also seen
    some tools to help manage and optimize costs.
