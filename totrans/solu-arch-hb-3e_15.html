<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Today’s organizations are operating in a challenging environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The pace of change is unprecedented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Regulators and institutions are imposing new reporting and security requirements, new technologies are disrupting consumers’ expectations and perceptions, and the ecosystem is constantly evolving as new players enter the market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">As a result, organizations are redefining their business models to provide the customer focus, agility, and technology they need to attract talent, be competitive, and grow.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Application modernization has become a critical component of these new business models to set up dev/test environments rapidly, experiment with new ideas, and develop new products and services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">In addition to eliminating the need to invest in expensive and cumbersome infrastructure, a new system enables innovation through a broad set of available technologies.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Legacy systems are applications that have been deployed in your data center for decades without undergoing many changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">These systems are outdated and challenging to maintain in a fast-changing technological environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Legacy systems are defined by age and the inability to meet growing business needs, due to the underlying architecture and technology.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Often, large enterprises deal with legacy applications to run crucial day-to-day business tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">These legacy systems are spread across many industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, and supply chain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">Often, companies have to spend heavily on the maintenance and support of these systems, which warrants the need to architect legacy systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.4">Rearchitecting and modernizing legacy applications helps organizations be more agile and innovative and optimizes cost and performance.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, you will learn about challenges and issues with legacy applications and techniques to rearchitect them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Rewriting complex legacy applications may pose an additional risk of business disruption, so you will learn about refactoring applications or considering the option to migrate into a more flexible infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">A legacy application presents significant challenges for an organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">On the one hand, there are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2075"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">critical applications that an organization has used for decades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">On the other hand, legacy applications hold back the organization’s pace of innovation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">End users are looking for the most modern, technologically advanced applications in a hugely competitive environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">All new features usually come with the latest software, and legacy applications limit your ability to add those features that benefit end users. </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Before we dive </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">into the solution, it’s essential to understand the issues clearly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">Let’s explore the challenges of legacy systems in more depth to understand them better.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-468"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Difficulty in keeping up with user demand</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Customer focus is the key to business success, and being unable to keep up with the latest technology trends can harm a business significantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You can take the example of Nokia, which used </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">to lead the global mobile phone market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">As smartphones came into play nearly a decade ago, Nokia still stuck with a legacy system, resulting in near bankruptcy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">It was a similar story with Kodak—one of the largest businesses in the camera industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">Kodak could not move with digital innovation and adopt it into its systems, which resulted in Kodak becoming bankrupt in 2012. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.5">There are many such examples of large enterprises being unable to survive due to a lack of legacy modernization and innovation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Users are very demanding in the current climate of fast-changing technology and fierce competition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Now, organizations have to change as per the user’s terms, as they have multiple choices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">As technology moves, the user moves with it and starts using the most recent and popular applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.4">Your competitors can jump ahead if they provide new features that the user needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.5">A recent example is Google, a pioneer in AI/ML that may have developed </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Generative AI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">GenAI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">) technology much earlier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">However, OpenAI moved swiftly to launch ChatGPT, putting Google on the back foot and forcing it into a catch-up game, consequently losing ground to competitors in the GenAI market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">These examples underline the importance of adopting emerging technologies to maintain a competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">A legacy system also challenges enterprise applications with an internal user base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">An old system built on mainframes primarily uses the command line, which could be more user-friendly in the digital age. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">In contrast, new-generation workers demand a more user-friendly approach to perform their routine tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.4">However, you may need more support from management, who may have been working with legacy systems for decades and are used to them.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The technology </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">at the core of large enterprises needs to be updated and comprises systems dating back decades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Organizations running their core systems on legacy, on-premises technology face severe challenges when enabling modern customer experiences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">Many systems are the product of multiple mergers and acquisitions, resulting in fractured data siloes, excessive infrastructure costs, and slow development time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.4">This creates inefficient processing and decision-making, a lack of business agility, poor customer responsiveness, and high maintenance costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.5">Under these conditions, it’s challenging for IT to meet the modern needs of internal stakeholders and customers.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-469"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Higher cost of maintenance and updates</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">As legacy systems have been set up and working for decades, they may look less expensive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">But over time, the total cost of ownership turns out to be higher, as support and updates for old systems are usually more costly.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Those updates </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">are often unavailable out of the box, and lots of manual workarounds are required to maintain the systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Most legacy systems are not automation-friendly, resulting in more human effort.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Legacy systems mostly have a large chunk of proprietary software, which results in significantly higher license fees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">In addition to that, old software no longer receives support from providers, and buying additional support out of the life cycle could be very costly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.3">On the other hand, modern systems mainly adopt open source technologies that drive the cost down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.4">The operational outage from a legacy system can take more time and drive up operating expenses, due to years of technical debt and hard-to-debug code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.5">People with the skill set to maintain legacy systems (such as DB2, COBOL, Fortran, Delphi, and Perl) are hard to find, significantly increasing hiring costs and system risk.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Legacy applications have been in operation for decades, and, over time, many changes will have been accommodated without unused code being removed, which amounts to lots of technical debt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Any initiative to reduce technical debt could be risky due to unknown impacts and dependencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">As a result, organizations are forced to invest in unnecessary code and system maintenance for fear of breaking a system by making any significant changes.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">However, modernizing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2080"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">legacy systems </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">may be costly due to unknown dependencies and outages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">A careful </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">cost-benefit analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">CBA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">) needs to be considered, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">the </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">return on investment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">ROI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">) needs to be determined when deciding to proceed with modernization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">As stakeholders need to see the immediate benefit of modernization, procuring finances for legacy modernization can be challenging.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-470"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Shortage of skills and documentation</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Legacy technologies (such as mainframes) have multiple complex components that depend on </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">They are extensive proprietary and costly servers that are not readily available if someone wants to develop skills for them independently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">It is challenging to retain application development resources and even more challenging to hire people with hands-on experience in old technology and operating systems.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Often, legacy systems are decades old, and most of the workforce with the relevant skills to manage them has retired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Also, these systems may need documentation to record the years of work that went into them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Significant knowledge loss is possible as an old workforce rotates with a new workforce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">A lack of knowledge makes it risky to change the system due to unknown dependencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">Any small feature requests are challenging to accommodate due to system complexity and skills shortages.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">New cutting-edge technologies such as advanced analytics, ML, GenAI, and the</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> Internet of Things</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">IoT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">) are built on new technology platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">As new technologies are not well integrated with legacy systems, an organization may lose out to a competitor if it cannot use the full capabilities of emerging technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">A modern system helps build an organization’s brand as an innovative company where most of the new generation of the workforce wants to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">Development and training are an even more significant expense for legacy technologies.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Often, automation helps to reduce costs by reducing human effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Many tools are available in modern systems to build automation—such as DevOps pipelines, code reviews, and automation testing—that a legacy system may not utilize, resulting in additional costs.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-471"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Vulnerability to corporate security issues</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Security is a top priority for any organization and system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">A legacy application on an old operating system (such as Windows XP or Windows 2008) is vulnerable to security issues due to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2084"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">a lack of vendor support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Software vendors continuously determine new security threats and release patches to accommodate them in the latest software versions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">Any legacy software announced as </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">End of Life</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">EOL</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">) from a vendor doesn’t get a new security patch, which leaves your application running in the old software version exposed to several security threats.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">System health checks are often ignored for legacy applications, which makes them more vulnerable to security attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">The skills gap makes providing continuous support and help difficult, which means systems need to be more secure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.3">A single vulnerability can pose a high risk of exposing your application, database, and critical information to attackers.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">In addition to a security vulnerability, legacy applications are complex to maintain due to compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">As regulations keep changing over time to enforce tight security around data handling and usage, legacy systems require changes to adhere to local governance and compliance needs.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">For example, compliance to the European Union’s </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">General Data Protection Regulation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">GDPR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">) requires </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">each system to enable users to request to delete their data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">While modern systems may provide these features out of the box in an automated and self-service manner, this may need to be performed manually and become more complex in legacy systems.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Adhering to compliance needs can lead to more operation costs and time-consuming maintenance.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-472"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Incompatibility with other systems</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">In addition to end users, often systems need to integrate with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">Those systems </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">may be associated with different departments, clients, partners, or suppliers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">The various systems need to exchange data in a standard format that evolves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">Almost every few years, files and data format standards are changed to increase data exchange efficiency, and most systems need to change to adopt them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">Hard-to-change legacy systems that stick to using an old format could result in system incompatibility and a system that your suppliers and partners may not want to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">The inability to accommodate standard needs adds significant business risk due to complex workarounds and lost productivity.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Adding a workaround for simple business needs may make a system more complex. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Modern systems are built on a service-oriented architecture, making it easier to accommodate any new requirement by adding a new service independently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">Old systems are often built with a monolithic architecture, and adding any new feature means you need to rebuild and test the entire system.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Modern </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">architectures are API-oriented and can be easily integrated with other systems to offload heavy lifting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">For example, a taxi-booking </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2088"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">app uses Google Maps for </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Global Positioning System</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">GPS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">) navigation and Facebook or X for user authentication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">A lack of APIs makes these integrations harder in a legacy system, resulting in complex custom code.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">A legacy application can face a scalability issue as load increases from another dependent upstream system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">Often, legacy applications are built with a monolithic architecture and are hardware-dependent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.3">Scalability is a big challenge with a monolithic system, as it cannot scale horizontally due to hardware dependency and vertical scaling being limited to the maximum system capacity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.4">Also, increased demand in one portion of the monolith requires the entire system to be scaled. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.5">Breaking monolithic applications into microservices can help with scaling challenges and keeping up with the load.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">In addition to software maintenance, legacy applications are costly for hardware infrastructure as they run on a particular version. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">They spread across multiple databases with duplicate data and similar functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">Due to their monolithic nature, it’s hard to consolidate and use the flexibility of cloud-based infrastructures to save costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">Also, decentralized systems allow software teams to select software stacks based on the needs of the microservice, rather than having to conform to a singular technology stack for all system functionality, enabling the use of diverse technologies based on the needs of each microservice and/or the team supporting the microservice.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Let’s look at some key advantages of system modernization.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-473"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Defining a strategy for system modernization</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Often, a legacy system gets left out of an enterprise’s overall digital strategy, and issues get addressed </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2089"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">as needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">A reactive approach prevents organizations from executing overall system modernization and benefits.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">If your legacy system has serious business challenges, such as security and compliance issues, or cannot </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">address a business need, you can take a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">big-bang approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">In the big-bang method, you build a new system from scratch and shut down the old system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">This approach is risky but addresses a business need that can be mitigated from the existing legacy system.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">The other </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2091"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">approach is a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">phased approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">, where you upgrade one module at a time and keep running both the old and the new systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">A phased</span><strong class="keyWord"> </strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">approach is less risky but takes a long time and may be more expensive, as you need to maintain both environments with increased network and infrastructure bandwidth.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Approaching your application portfolio, prioritizing specific applications, and having an overall plan are the first steps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">As you use the cloud, you design a new operating model and end up with a combination of tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">You can use third-party tools to frame your needs and tool preferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">And finally, you can use a consulting partner to complete migration and modernization projects more successfully and quickly.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Taking any of these approaches can provide various benefits once the modernization of an application is completed.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-474"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Assessment of a legacy application</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">An organization may have multiple legacy systems, with tens of thousands to millions of code lines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">In a modernization situation, a legacy system must align with the business strategy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2092"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">and the investment cost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">Also, it is possible to reutilize some parts or completely write them from scratch, but the first step is to conduct the assessment and better understand the overall system. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">In the assessment phase, the solutions architect needs to make the system easy to assess more quickly and make informed decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Assessments can be done in days and weeks, depending upon the size of your workload and its complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">The following points are the primary areas that solutions architects need to focus on when conducting an assessment:</span></p>

<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Technology assessment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">: You need to understand the technology stack used by the existing system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">If the current technology is outdated and lacks vendor support, you might need to replace it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Consider upgrading if a better version of the technology becomes available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">Often, newer versions are backward-compatible, with minimal changes required.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Architecture assessment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">: You need to understand the overall architecture to make it future-proof. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">There may be a case where you need to make a minor upgrade to the technology but the overall architecture needs to be more monolithic and scalable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">It would be best to audit the architecture in relation to cost, scalability, availability, performance, and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">Significant architecture changes may be required to align the application with business needs.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Code and dependency assessment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">: Legacy systems often have hundreds of thousands of lines of code in a monolithic setting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">Various modules tied to each other make the system very complicated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">Code that appears not to be used in one module might impact other modules if it is removed without due diligence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.4">These code lines may have been written decades back and needed regular refactoring and review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.5">Even if the technology and architecture look fine, you must determine if the code is upgradable and maintainable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.6">You also need to understand whether UI-related upgrades are required to improve the user experience.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">As a solutions architect, you want to determine the dependencies across various modules </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2093"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">and code files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Modules may be tightly coupled, and you must define an approach to perform simultaneous upgrades when modernizing the overall architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">During your assessment, you may find the following patterns:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">First, many customers realize they have many old apps that do not relate well to the future business model; they can be retired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">For example, around 10–20% of the app portfolio can be retired.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Second, thousands of SaaS vendors didn’t exist 5–7 years ago; these can replace many on-premises apps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">For example, most customers have landed on Salesforce as a CRM platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">This shift to SaaS shrinks down the operational portfolio managed by IT operations—it still presents security and identity work but has lower operation costs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Then, decisions can be made to lift and shift and, during a move, replatform the operating system, database, or language to reduce costs, such as customers choosing to re-platform </span><a id="_idIndexMarker2094"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">from Windows Server to Linux, and from Oracle to Postgres, to reduce database licensing costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">You learned about these techniques in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Chapter 3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Cloud Migration and Hybrid Cloud Architecture Design</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">.</span></p>
