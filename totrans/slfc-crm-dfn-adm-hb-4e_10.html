Often these devices were regarded as a nice accessory by management, and seen as a company perk by field-based teams.</p><p>Today, mobile devices are almost ubiquitous within the business environment, and organizations of all sizes are realizing the benefits of using mobile phones and devices to access business applications.</p><p>Salesforce has taken the lead in recognizing how mobile has become the new standard for being connected in people's personal and professional lives. And how more and more, the users of their apps are living lives connected to the Internet, but rather than sitting at a desk in the office, they are in between meetings, on the road, in planes, in trains, in cabs, or even in the queue for lunch. As a result, Salesforce have developed innovative mobile solutions that help you and your users embrace this mobile-first world in Salesforce CRM.</p><p>The following topics are being covered in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Accessing Salesforce mobile solutions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce mobile products overview</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SalesforceA</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce Touch</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce Classic</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mobile Administration Console</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce1</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mobile Dashboards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce Adoption Manager</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Accessing Salesforce mobile solutions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec112"/>Accessing Salesforce mobile solutions</h1></div></div></div><p>Salesforce offers two varieties of mobile solutions, namely mobile browser apps and downloadable apps. Mobile browser apps, as the name suggests, are accessed using a web browser that is available on a mobile device. Downloadable apps are accessed by first downloading the client software from, say, the Apple App Store or Google Play and then installing it onto the mobile device. Mobile browser apps and downloadable apps offer various features and benefits and, as will be covered, are available for various Salesforce mobile products and device combinations.</p><p>Most mobile devices these days have some degree of web browser capability, which may be used to access Salesforce CRM, however some Salesforce mobile products are optimized for use with certain devices. By accessing a Salesforce mobile browser app, your users do not require anything to be installed. Supported mobile browsers for Salesforce are generally available on Android, Apple, BlackBerry, and Microsoft Windows 8.1 devices.</p><p>Downloadable apps, on the other hand, will require the app to be first downloaded from the App Store for Apple devices or from Google Play for Android devices and then installed on the mobile device.</p></div></div>

<span class="strong"><strong>
<span class="strong"><strong>SalesforceA</strong></span>
</strong></span> is a downloadable system administration app that allows you to manage your organization users and view certain information on your Salesforce organization from your mobile device. <span class="strong"><strong>SalesforceA</strong></span> is intended to be used by system administrators as it is restricted to users with the <code class="literal">Manage Users</code> permission.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>SalesforceA</strong></span> app provides the facilities to carry out user tasks such as deactivating or freezing users, resetting passwords, unlocking users, editing user details, calling and emailing users, and assigning permission sets.</p><p>These user task buttons are displayed as action icons as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

</p><p>In addition to the user tasks, you can view system status and also switch between your user accounts in multiple organization. This allows you to access different organizations and communities without having to log out and log back in to each user account.

If you disable this option, the checkbox is immediately removed from the Salesforce Classic Mobile Settings page and unlicensed users are unable to use the Salesforce Classic Mobile app. Furthermore, if you deselect this option while users are running the app, the Salesforce data on their devices is erased the next time the devices synchronize with Salesforce.</p><p>If you disable the free version of Salesforce Classic Mobile in error, contact Salesforce customer support for assistance restoring access for unlicensed users.</p><p>Salesforce Classic Lite access is an organization-wide setting.
