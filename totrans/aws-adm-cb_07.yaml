- en: Networking is a foundational component of using other AWS services such as EC2,
    RDS, and others. Using constructs such as VPCs and NAT gateways gives you the
    capability and confidence to secure your resources at a networking level. At a
    DNS level, Route 53 provides connectivity to your users in a responsive and fault-tolerant
    way that ensures the best performance in a variety of scenarios.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only parameter required for this template is the VPC ID to target. We specifically
    target a VPC to turn on flow-logging for, because it gives us the most *bang for
    buck*. While you can enable flow-logs for subnets and **Elastic Network Interfaces**
    (**ENIs**) individually, if you enable them on a VPC you get flow-logs for all
    the networking resources contained in that VPC—which includes subnets and ENIs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the resources section, we start by explicitly defining the log group to *hold*
    the flow-logs. If you don't create the log group yourself (and specify it in your
    flow-log resource configuration), a log group will be created for you. This means
    that you will still be able to use flow-logs, but the log group won't be managed
    by CloudFormation and will have to be maintained (for example, deleted) manually.
    We have also set a **deletion policy** of *delete* for our log group. This means
    it will be deleted if the CloudFormation stack is deleted, which is fine for a
    demonstration such as this. If using in a *real* environment (such as production),
    remove the `DeletionPolicy` property and its value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, CloudWatch log groups are *not* deleted when the stack that created
    them is deleted. This lets you retain any important logs, but it can incur an
    ongoing cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we define the IAM role to use. Via the `AssumeRolePropertyDocument` value,
    we give the AWS flow-logs service permission to assume this role. Without this
    access, the flow-logs service cannot access the account. In the `Policies` property,
    we give the role permission to create and update log groups and streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, now that we have created the dependent resources, we define the flow-log
    resource itself. You don't need to define the resources in order of dependencies,
    but it is usually easier to read if you do. In the resource, we also define a
    `DependsOn` relationship to the log group we defined earlier, so that the log
    group is ready to receive the flow-logs when it is created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final step is to launch the template you have created, passing the VPC ID
    as parameter. As this template creates an IAM role to allow the VPC service to
    send logs to CloudWatch logs, the command to create the stack must be given the
    `CAPABILITY_IAM` flag to signify that you are aware of the potential impact of
    launching this template.
