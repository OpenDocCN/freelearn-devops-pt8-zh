<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">Continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) is the practice of using automated tools to compile automatically and continuously, based on changes made by developers to source code, and packaging and testing them to ensure they are stable and able to provide the <span class="No-Break">expected functionality.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">Continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CD</strong>) uses the artifacts created via CI and deploys those applications without human intervention to end users, ensuring these are always updated with the latest versions and, in most cases, performing additional verifications in multiple environments before reaching the final <span class="No-Break">end users.</span></p>
<p>All of this is possible by taking advantage of Azure Pipelines, one of the leading platforms to support all aspects of the <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>); however, in this book, we will focus on the CI/CD aspects and how to take advantage of the features available to effect the different task automation options under the DevOps umbrella, even touching on the <span class="No-Break">DevSecOps aspects.</span></p>
<p>In this book, we provide you with the tools to get started, by learning the basic concepts and building from there to more complex scenarios. This will lead to end-to-end scenarios that enable your software development teams with the tools to automate, every step of the way, the delivery of applications, from source code to a <span class="No-Break">running platform.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>From beginners to the most advanced users, anybody looking to better understand how to take advantage of Azure Pipelines can benefit from <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<p>The three main personas who are the target audience of this content are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Software developers</strong>: They will learn how they can automatically build and deploy their software products, regardless of the target platform, at very early stages to speed up the SDLC</li>
<li><strong class="bold">DevOps engineers</strong>: They will learn how Azure Pipelines can support any automation need, no matter the stage in the process, infusing quality and checks every step of the way</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security engineers</strong>: They will learn how they can integrate their tools in the CI/CD process to enforce security and quality at the beginning of the build and deployment process</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
