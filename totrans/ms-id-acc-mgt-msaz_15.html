<p><span>Organizations need to build a security culture to provide a suitable information-protection solution. In this chapter, you will get</span> <span><span>an</span></span> overview <span><span>of</span></span><span> the four main pillars of security</span> culture, which are le<span>adership support, efficient t</span><span><span>raining,</span> ongoing<span> testing, and c</span></span><span>ontinuous communication to the entire organization and its partners. If you don't establish a security culture, you will have difficulty being successful in every part of an information-protection strategy, because every employee needs to know what information needs to be protected. </span>Furthermore, the introduction of security measures can result in high costs if they are not sufficiently planned and not supported by the management.</p>
<p>An additional focus in this chapter is data classification, as the classification of information provides the basis for most security mechanisms. The classification of information provides context for the factors that lead to security policies taking effect and triggering the right level of protection. Also, we will explain how applying the four main parts of a security culture leads to supporting the introduction of data classification. Finally, we will have our first contact with the Microsoft classification and protection solution to introduce the practical application in the following chapters.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The ideas, duties, and behaviors of a group of people influence their security and can put them at risk, hence there is a need for security culture. In the professional world, security culture is used to describe the kinds of behaviors organizations would like to see in their employees in areas such as cyber, physical, and personal security. Security training and the change of the behavior of a co-worker to adapt to the safety guidelines of the enterprise are necessary. The main focus of a security culture is keeping infiltrators or other potentially damaging parties out. In our case, we will focus on the relevance to data security, because to handle the complete field of security goes beyond the scope and focus of this book. So, let's see what this means for us.</p>
<p><span>Digital transformation has reshaped the way we work. Data has become the new currency of business. </span><span>Information such as development results, intended company acquisitions, sales account information, personal or financial data, and security information have very high values in organizations. </span><span>A lot of the information and data created or exported from systems flows into and through organizations, out into the cloud, and across the Internet of Things. More and more data is in motion, and this creates more and more risk. </span><span>This fact leads organizations to make e</span><span>xtensive investments in data security, to protect their </span><span>intellectual property and the tr</span><span>ust of their customers.</span></p>
<p>Technology alone doesn't solve the problems in the field of data security. Furthermore, if you think data security is only an IT task, you will remain vulnerable to breaches caused by user activity. Many security professionals still focus too much on processes and technology, or just on technology. This fact puts organizations in an unbalanced and weak position. We need to include all the employees in our strategy because if we don't, we leave the organization vulnerable to an attack factor that's nearly half of the current breaches in the actual cyber security world. In an enterprise, the elements, people, processes, and technology must be in harmony to create a strong foundation for a proper security culture, a successful data security strategy, and digital transformation.</p>
<p>In organizations with a proper security culture, employees have a clear understanding about what is right and wrong, the type of activity they should report, and how to contact the right team. <span>On the other hand, in organizations with a weak security culture, security becomes someone else's responsibility. A vital fact of an effective security culture is to have a shared sense of ownership.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>So, it's quite important to understand that you need to engage and educate employees to make better decisions on how information is handled. By prompting your users to pause and consider the business value of the information they own and control, you're empowering them to use it in a way that won't put your corporate data at risk. The use of data classification enables employees to handle sensitive content correctly.</p>
<p>Already during the creation of information, or when saving, the employee is supposed to categorize the information correctly and to trigger the right protection. Besides, the employee learns to better assess the need for security and the value of the information for the company in the future, as well as to adapt their handling of sensitive content to the organizational guidelines. The data classification additionally provides the factors that are essential for security reports. It will also trigger the execution of security functions at the right time to keep the business in a secure state. </p>
<p class="mce-root">You can invest a lot of money and energy in improving your security processes and technology controls. If you don't include your end users within your organization, the risk of data breaches will still be high. <span>The most important task you need to work on is educating and empowering</span><span> </span><span>your users to make qualified decisions in handling the information of their daily work. To provide an appropriate security solution, you need to give a natural flow for the end user in their daily work and apply and enforce policies to avoid the violation of security rules.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">By helping users to classify and give value to the information they create, they become active participants in the protection and security of data. </p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next section, we will discuss the four pillars of a security culture.</p>

<p>Now that we have highlighted the need for a security culture, let's look at its four main components. As we have already mentioned in the introduction, we will discuss the following four areas, which are the cornerstone of a <span>healthy and sustainable security culture</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership support</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Continuous communication</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You will get an overview and tips that will help to you install a high-quality security culture in your organization. Keep in mind that an organization's security culture is the foundation of any security control and should be supported by an information-protection strategy. In the next part of this section, we will start with the leadership support you need to support an information-protection strategy.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">An information-protection strategy and the associated security culture always has to start with the top-level executives and board members. This will provide the funding for appropriate resources to develop, implement, and maintain the information-protection strategy, which includes the security culture.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Making security a part of everyone's responsibilities is key to a living security culture and reliable data security. For example, if a data-classification project is launched without management support, there is a high probability that the project will fail. Often, the reasons are that the necessary resources are not available or that processes and business alignment have changed.</p>
<p>Your executive sponsors should continually be kept up to date on the progress, because they will be ready to address any significant blocks. Solutions and initiatives should always be aligned with the business goals and the processes of the organization. Furthermore, you should engage and establish department/team champions so that they understand and support your strategy and implement it at a very early stage. They will also be an excellent<span> resource for feedback to improve your solution.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">We often see that the efforts to develop and implement an information-protection strategy and security culture falls into the hands of the IT department. As we already know, we are not talking about a purely technical solution. Complete success relies heavily on the users of an organization and their activities. Finally, don't forget that the executives should lead by example, because the rest of the organization will look up to them. This means that the executives should be an active part of pilots and live by the new strategy and culture. Be aware that they need to have special support during the implementation.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">As we mentioned in the <em>Why do we need a security culture?</em> section, it's<span> essential to engage and educate employees to make better decisions in the handling of information. An appropriate data classification software can help you to address the engagement and education of your employees. Here are various effective training strategies to address the critical ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Educate users and communicate what you are trying to classify and protect.</li>
<li>Provide information that helps the user to get a better understanding of what is right and wrong.</li>
<li>Use a <span>mentoring approach rather than a punitive one.</span></li>
<li>Use easy and natural language.</li>
<li>Ensure your feedback loop is in place.</li>
<li>Decide the training needs as per the role of the user and the associated risk, such as data or image loss of the company if the employee leaves or incorrectly handles information.</li>
<li>Your information gathering doesn't need to be perfect; try to get as close to 100% as possible.</li>
<li>Use an iterative approach while making improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, you need to align the training needs to the associated risk, such as data loss of a specific user group. For example, <span>data classification is a typi</span>cal general <span>topic everyone should be trained in. Let's think about an engineer; they should hav</span>e an intermediate level of tra<span>ining in how they need to handle their results. The administrator who manages all the results of the engineers of an organization should have a</span>n in-depth <span>training level, because they are maintaining all the jewels of the organization. So, they need to </span><span>know</span><span> </span><span>exactly what to do to secure the information.</span></p>
<p>In essence, data classification will help your organization to improve its culture of information-security awareness significantly. So, invest in supporting and training your users in that field. Take feedback from users, listen to them, and continually improve your training material.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following training approaches could be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference posters or cheat sheets a user can keep on their desk</li>
<li>Training videos that are placed on internal portals often used by your users</li>
<li>A corporate video with an executive about the importance of the information-protection strategy and the security culture, which shows the leading-by-example approach</li>
<li>Online forums or knowledge systems that are used inside the organization</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that users may consume and use the training materials in a different way, depending on their role within the organization. In the next section, we will describe the testing needs inside a security culture and the implementation of an information-protection solution.</p>

<p>Active testing and monitoring of the information-protection strategy is crucial to keep the security culture alive. In the case of data classification, the primary goal is to achieve user acceptance of your defined data-classification labels and policies to ensure that users do not resort to cheating. To make sure that you are headed in the right direction, you need to define specific test scenarios aligned with your critical success factors in order to validate and satisfy the significant business and functional requirements for your classifications and policies.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that often only a small part of the information you communicate to your recipients is clearly understood. Due to this, it is essential to check global communication in small test groups that can be adjusted if necessary. Furthermore, build active monitoring of the information-protection activities and reference it to the context of the information, so that you can test the accurate classification and applied protection of the data. Your technical solution should provide you with a useful toolkit to achieve this target.</p>

<p>An essential tool for transforming user behavior is continuous communication, starting from when you begin making changes to the organization's culture. In the beginning, it is necessary to communicate your mission to all your users. By communicating clearly, everything is aligned with the core values and the corporate commitments of the organization, and how the information protection strategy and security culture stick to these commitments <span>–</span> users can see the bigger picture of the security investment and can identify themselves as an essential part of the whole solution.</p>
<p>Let's also discuss the "what's in it for me?" factor. For example, employees need to make sure their work is aligned with the information security policies they signed on day one of their employment. For an active and thriving communication process, it's essential that you are approachable and share the improvements that you get from user feedback.</p>

<p>After we describe the necessity and the four central elements of the security culture, we will discuss the data classification to create the basis for a successful solution in the area of information protection. As already mentioned, data classification provides the necessary information and tools for the correct use of protective measures. Let's start with a basic definition of data classification. <span>It is a continuous process of consistently categorizing information based on specific and predefined criteria so that the data can be efficiently verified, effectively identified, and protected. This is why data classification is the foundation of data security.</span></p>
<p>Successful data classification requires a broad awareness of the needs of an organization and a thorough understanding of where the data assets are located and how data or information is generated. For this reason, finding and identifying existing data on various endpoints, such as network shares, databases, or cloud services, is closely tied to classification. Even when creating new data, classification is always carried out.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">In addition to the different endpoints at which data is usually available, there are three basic states in which data can be located: in idle mode, during processing, and during transport. All three states require technical solutions for data classification. However, the principles used are the same for all three states. Unfortunately, data classification must always be done in the creation process. For example, confidential data about all the three states must be treated confidentially. Furthermore, a distinction has to be made between structured and unstructured data. In typical classification processes, structured data in databases or tables is less complicated than unstructured data such as documents, source code, or email messages.</p>
<p>Overall, it is crucial to manage unstructured and structured data based on their sensitivity level. A correct implementation of a data-classification solution leads to the creation of sensitive and confidential data with proper foresight. It can be decided whether information can be made publicly available or not.</p>
<p>In discussions with our customers, we have often heard about their reluctance to adopt data-classification solutions. However, such comments can often be refuted quickly. The following three examples exhibit the crucial aspects of data classification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data classification is too complicated</strong>:<strong> </strong>In fact, many data-classification projects fail or get stuck because of classification schemes that are too complex. The data-classification schema provides different labels to apply the classification to the information. For example, the Confidential label is used for sensitive information that should not be accessible by unauthorized users. Often, we find concepts that use labels the users are not able to understand, or labels that conflict with other labels. Consequently, it is advisable to start an iterative process and only with the necessary options.</li>
<li><strong>Data classification is just another step I need to take, and it makes me slow</strong>: Classifying data can simplify data protection. Knowing what information is confidential allows you to choose a suitable location to store the data or adopt a protective measure. It's important to understand why and how data is protected. Furthermore, data classification has the advantage that data can be found more easily and the employee can also protect themself by classifying the information correctly and applying the appropriate protection.</li>
<li><strong>Data classification pays off only after a long time</strong>: Automated classification can provide insights from day one. The automation of the two areas of context and content can be quickly and easily created in a certain order and additional information can be obtained to promote safety improvements. You will find out more about the different classification methods in the <em>Methods of data classification</em> section.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Now that we have established a basic definition of data classification, let's discuss the different methods of data classification.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we will work through different methods of data classification, explaining each process and providing the essential arguments for the methods, including what information will be gained for the classified information. To understand these methods, it is essential that you are able to define the correct and most efficient way to your classification system. There are two basic methods of classifying data: manually through interaction with the user, and automatically through classification software based on a set of rules.</p>
<p>For data classification, the following four methods are usually used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the user's choice (manual)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on the manual selection of the user</li>
<li>Should be combined with an automatic process based on content and context that recommends the appropriate classification</li>
<li>Reclassification should be controlled and monitored</li>
<li>Based on the knowledge of the user when creating, editing, or reviewing sensitive in<span>formation</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Information gained</strong>: What is the content and context of a document?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the content (manual/automatically)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on examining and interpreting sensitive content using regular expressions, metadata, or other options</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Information gained</strong>: What is the content of a document?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on the context (manual/automatically)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on the application, location, or creator, as well as other variables and indicators of sensitive information</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Information gained</strong>: Who accesses it? When will the data be accessed? Where is the data moving? How is the data used?</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supported by machine learning (manual/automatically)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on document classes around automatic classification by comparison with comparison sets and training</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Information gained</strong>: System learns to integrate further options into the classification or to increase the recognition of certain information.</p>
<p>The combination of different classification methods combines the different positive properties of the individual methods, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata-based classification allows exceptionally high speeds</li>
<li>Pattern-matching is fast and safe for classification criteria that can be identified with regular expressions</li>
<li>Machine learning with linguistic-statistical methods is generally applicable and gives very good results with fuzzy criteria</li>
<li>Special classifiers, such as image recognition, can be another method</li>
</ul>
<p>The combined and continuous use of these methods leads to success.</p>
<p><span>Now that we know the different classification methods, we can address the challenges facing organizations where the use of data classification can support a fundamental improvement in the management of information and the efficient use of security technology.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>An essential aspect of why data classification is necessary is the amount of information generated within a company. The amount of information is often unmanageable and unusable. The management of unstructured data is still one of the larger unresolved issues of storage technologies. Still, about 80% of the stored data is probably unstructured, which is beyond the capabilities of an economical and sustainable information-management process. However, the critical challenge of process-aware allocation exists in both structured and unstructured data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current data volume does not indicate any externally visible information about the content and the intended use. If we use a classification scan with a few simple keywords or analyze the metadata, there can be more transparency of the different types of data. The results are gaps in the management of the company's information, which should be identified by the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive information that needs special protection</li>
<li>Important and/or regulated information that needs to be archived</li>
<li>Passive information that is seldom needed</li>
<li>Superfluous information that could be deleted</li>
<li>Technical log information with special treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, the recommended way of creating a classification is to create the necessary transparency about the contents of the company's-relevant information. </p>
<p>In addition, the following advantages also result from the data classification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Allows a company to group data consistently across its business functions, regardless of its format or delivery system.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Optimization</strong>: Gives an introduction of a storage classification concept (tiered storage model).</li>
<li><strong>Data value</strong>: This allows data to be differentiated according to its value for the company.</li>
<li><strong>Archiving</strong>: Introduction of an archive for better information retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Information type and relevant attributes are visible from the outside.</li>
<li><strong>Synergies</strong>: Users and applications can use the information.</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Efficient and sustainable protection mechanisms can be controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Proof of information in processes and groups for processing.</li>
<li><strong>Unity</strong>: In the company or organization by following the same principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have seen the advantages of data classification in the field of unstructured data, we can view the use case of data leakage and loss prevention.</p>

<p><strong>Data Leakage/Loss Prevention</strong> (<strong>DLP</strong>) is the term used to denote solutions designed to prevent the uncontrolled outflow of information from the company. DLP is one of the IT measures for risk management. Today's DLP solutions provide only a fraction of their potential, because the rule definition for the permission and prevention of access by filing structures and other technical attributes is complicated. Since today's solutions often lack the appropriate methods for integrating the specialist pages, the specialist departments often do not feel responsible. Thus, DLP remains in many cases a blunt sword in the fight against the unauthorized outflow of information.</p>
<p class="mce-root">With the introduction of the manual and automated classification of all files, DLP can act on the classification rather than having to be painstakingly managed through the filing structure. You will find the information about the different classification methods in the <em>Methods of data classification</em> section. This is visible in frequently changing structures in the filesystem. The rule definition is intrinsically useful across the enterprise, and the administration expenditure sinks drastically. The concept of classification and document classes makes it much easier to integrate the specialist pages.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In risk management, too, the efficiency of already established solutions, for example in the area of ​​DLP, can be increased many times over by using a classification.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Next, we will focus on data classification and compliance aspects.</p>

Today, many important pieces of information that need to be archived from a compliance point of view remain unarchived because they are not recognized as requiring archiving by the system or process. An example of this is the many contract-relevant files that end up in the filesystem. In particular, the large stocks of data on file servers represent a black box for many companies, in which the relevance for specific compliance issues is only partially known. Through the automated classification of all files in the company, relevant information is recognized and archived by the classification. Through the cross-company approach and automation, a significantly higher degree of completeness is achieved here.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Next, we will discuss how data classification can help to optimize your storage usage.</p>

<p>Hierarchical storage management or tiered storage is the optimization of storage costs by using different performance levels to reduce the use of expensive storage systems. Files are moved from the cost-intensive systems to the lower-cost system according to different selection criteria, without users or applications noticing.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Traditional solutions typically work exclusively with technical attributes, such as file type or age, to decide on the ability of a file to migrate to less expensive storage. They usually provide too rough a grid of selection criteria to be really efficient in practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of a suitable approach to get information about the swap capabilities of file stocks from the trade pages.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The professional classification of the file and the assignment of document classes, such as an invoice, employment contract, or construction plan, provide a better way to formulate outsourcing rules. Furthermore, these rules are entirely independent of the actual structures on the file servers and therefore much easier in administration.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Classification allows storage management to be much more efficient by managing files based on their value to the business.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Previous mechanisms for access protection were based on filing structures such as folders and shares. Thus, different views cannot be displayed. There is a conflict between high administrative effort on the one hand and uncontested need for protection on the other. Also, this method is entirely dependent on the correct behavior of users; if they misplace information, the information is visible to unauthorized people. Ultimately, files are therefore insufficiently protected today.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now that we have worked through several use cases where data classification can be helpful, we will discuss the related information about the relationship between data classification and the access-control mechanisms.</p>

<p>In terms of data classification and subsequent information protection, the authentication of a user is upstream. Authentication of a user typically consists of two parts—the username or ID to identify the user, and a password to confirm that the user's credentials are valid. Authentication does not provide the user with access to information or services. It is just a verification that the user is who they claim to be.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>After the a<span>uthentication </span>of the user takes place, authorization is the process of giving an authenticated user the ability to access an application or information. Assigning the rights assigned to an authenticated user to access the information requires attention to data classification. Due to the upstream authentication, it is necessary to gain a better insight into which sensitive data is affected in the case of compromise. The following list provides some of the most critical data examples that can be affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>User credentials and passwords</li>
<li>Credentials and passwords of privileged users</li>
<li>Identifiable personal information of customers</li>
<li>Financial data from customers</li>
<li>Intellectual property</li>
<li>Personnel/employee data</li>
<li>Financial data of the company</li>
<li>Medical information</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) or sensor-related data and metadata</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Control System</strong> (<strong>ICS</strong>) command and control data</li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant impacts of attacking an organization are in the area of corporate trust, legal concerns, and brand reputation. The following list provides the critical areas of an organization that can be affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise customer confidence</li>
<li>Brand reputation</li>
<li>Direct loss of sales</li>
<li>Legal</li>
<li>Improvement of protective controls (costs)</li>
<li>Financial loss</li>
<li>Regulatory fines (compliance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data classification may be required by a variety of factors, such as specific regulation, <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), Federal Act on Data Protection DSG, <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong>HIPAA</strong>), and <strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong>PCI DSS</strong>), or intellectual property protection.</p>

<p>The following section describes an exemplary classification scheme and associated guidelines to clarify the activities and processes involved in data classification. The following classification scheme represents a grading in terms of sensitivity and provides information on the expected effects and any necessary encryption of the information.</p>
<div class="packt_quote packt_tip">To be successful with your organization in an information-protection deployment, the basic requirement is to pick well-<span>standardized labels and a common language to connect with the data-security-specific terms.</span></div>

<p>Now that we have an overview of the classification scheme, let's jump into more details with examples of the affected information by a classification label.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The following classification labels and associated guidelines explain the example classification schema from the previous section, <em>Classification scheme and policy example</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public—General information</strong>: Company information expressly approved for publication.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Marketing material, published quarterly results.</li>
<li>The authorization according to the corporate communication policy should take place before the classification. Until approval is granted, information will be classified as Secret, Confidential, or Internal. There are no other information security restrictions for public information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal—Internal information</strong><span>: </span>Information that can be shared across the enterprise but not for release outside the company. Often the standard classification for company information.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Department announcements, project reports, employee contact details.</li>
<li>Internal information may only be shared with employees, contractors, or business partners. Access should be from proprietary IT systems using enterprise-approved applications and services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>General—General business information</strong>: Business data that is not intended for public consumption.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Com<span>pany's internal telephone directory, organizational charts, internal standards, and most internal communication.</span></li>
<li>However, this information can be shared with external partners, as required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Confidential—Confidential information</strong>: Information that, if compromised, may harm the company's interests or cause significant disruption or embarrassment to the company or its employees. Access is therefore restricted to authorized persons or groups only.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Personal data, contract negotiations, trading strategies, upstream technical data.</li>
<li>The following restrictions apply to secret information:
<ul>
<li>It must clearly indicate the classification in the header or footer of each page or slide.</li>
<li>A need-to-know practice must be known and implemented in the case of contractors and business partners where a confidentiality agreement exists.</li>
<li>Store the information on corporate IT systems and access the information only through enterprise-approved applications and services.</li>
<li>Storage on portable devices or removable media is only with an active encryption.</li>
<li>Encrypt the information when sending email or external exchange, as encryption of email messages is a good safety practice.</li>
<li>Confidential information may only be shared or stored in the business-collaboration application, where access is restricted to an authorized person or group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_quote packt_tip">Keep in mind that everyone should have a common set of labels. Don't make it too complicated. If you have special needs, such as top-secret projects, acquisitions, or mergers, scope the labels to the correct group of users.</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ul>
<li><strong>SECRET—Secret information</strong>: Information of high value or sensitivity that could cause a <span>serious</span><span> </span><span>corporate group compromise. Access is therefore limited to a small number of high-trust individuals.</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Acquisition plans, unpublished company results, preliminary assessments of economically sensitive exploration opportunities.</li>
<li>The following restrictions apply to secret information:
<ul>
<li>Display the classification in the header or footer of each page or slide, or in the first line of an email (but not in the subject line). Display the name and title of the information owner and a SECRET disclaimer on the first page or slide.</li>
<li>Sharing information only where "need-to-know" exists, and most of all only with trusted people from the "in-the-know" list managed by the information owner.</li>
<li>Store information only on corporate IT systems and access by using applications that are allowed for secret information. For example, these applications have multi-factor authentication and encryption.</li>
<li>Secret information should not be included in emails to external parties unless they are appropriately encrypted. Instead, an email with a link to a saved file should be sent to an authorized system.</li>
<li>Secret information should only be shared internally via links to files stored on an authorized IT system. If not possible, an encrypted email can be used internally.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The following tasks can be performed by each role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data owners</strong>: The owner of the information is the original creator of the data, who can delegate the ownership or delegate the administration to a data manager. When a file is created, the owner should be able to assign a classification. For this reason, they must understand the classification scheme and the associated guidelines, or be supported in the classification process in order to be able to set the correct classification. Finally, the data owner decides on the access to the information.</li>
<li><strong>Data managers</strong>: The data manager is instructed by the data owner to manage the information. They manage the information in accordance with the data owner's instructions, taking into account the applicable guidelines and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Administrator</strong>: An administrator represents a user who is responsible for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of the data. The administrator is not a data owner. The administrator role includes backing up and restoring data and managing records.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: Includes anyone who has been granted access to data or a file. Users have only user privileges and nothing else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, after discussing the different roles needed to process and manage data, we'll look at a short description about the change of the data classification label in the upcoming section.</p>

<p>Reclassifying or changing the classification status of an item of information must be done by a user, or the system determines that the importance or risk profile of the object has changed. This effort is essential to ensure that the classification status remains current and valid. Content that is not classified manually may be adjusted automatically or based on the use of the data owner or data manager.</p>
<p>In this section, we have worked through a general overview of data classification, which we will use in <a href="bf7343f1-51f5-4e33-a9a6-e6e682e58071.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Identifying and Detecting Sensitive Data,</em> and <a href="1bedc98d-8713-410f-b51b-04c8e97de9bf.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Configuring Azure Information Protection Solutions</em>. To provide an overview of the critical technology that we will use, we work through an introduction to <strong>Azure Information Protection</strong> (<strong>AIP</strong>) in the next section.</p>

<p>Microsoft has developed a complete data-classification and data-protection solution to meet the current and future needs of its customers and partners. <span>AIP</span> was designed based on the following form factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classify your data based on sensitivity</li>
<li>Protect your data at all times</li>
<li>Add visibility and control for users and administrators</li>
<li>Support a more secure way of collaborating</li>
<li>Easy-to-use toolset</li>
<li>High deployment and management capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of <span>AIP</span> and the related security services. In the coming chapters, we will do a deep dive into each component and build a sample solution configuration:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ae7c55a3-0631-4ca5-8cf4-c65aaafc4ac6.png" width="987" height="740"/></p>
<p><span>The following benefits are provided by AIP:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy settings</strong>: The administrators of <span>AIP</span> are provided with a set of the most common default labels, which can be modified to fit your requirements and needs</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows the new Un<span>ified Labeling capabilities through the <strong>Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance</strong> center, which merges the Office 365 and the Azure Information Protection labeling system:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Classification</strong>: Data can be classified based on content, context, and source, as well as automatically or manually by users, or in a combination.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Combination of manual and automatic classification is recommended. It is shown to the user as follows:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Labels will be added as metadata within a document. The labels are included in clear text so that other systems can read the values, for example the own Cloud App Security solution, which is a Cloud Access Security broker from Microsoft.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The following example shows the metadata of a classified document:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_Enabled True<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_SiteId 44b1e89f-e859-4a9b-8168-3438aea2529a<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_Owner jochen.nickel@emslabs.ch<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_SetDate 2018-11-12T14:53:49.6671922Z<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_Name General<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_Application Microsoft Azure Information Protection<br/> MSIP_Label_193d509a-931b-427b-bd10-45fa5a9ba362_Extended_MSFT_Method Manual<br/> Sensitivity General</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection</strong>: The encryption of documents and the authentication requirements are solved by the existing Azure Rights Management services or Active Directory Rights Management services, which allow you to define fine-grained permissions on the protected information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Here, you can see custo<span>m protection settings in the </span><span>Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring, tracking, and logging</strong>: Users can track activities on their shared information and can revoke access immediately. Administrators are also able to monitor and log information about the administrative tasks, classification, and protection events.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: <span class="packt_screen">Revoke acces</span><span class="packt_screen">s</span> <span>to a document:</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following diagram shows the main interactions on the main paths to protect information through its life cycle:</p>

<p>We can also see that the <span>AIP</span> solution is a part of the Microsoft Cyber Security Architecture (information protection). You can learn more about the cyber security architecture of Microsoft at <a href="https://bit.ly/2Sh1zN2">https://bit.ly/2Sh1zN2</a>.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">AIP provides a suitable framework for data classification. There are still many limitations in the product. With other vendors, such as TITUS, you can fill the gaps and provide a suitable solution. You can find more information at <a href="https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq">https://bit.ly/2Gbu0Wq</a>.</div>
<p>Now that we have seen a small starter on <span>AIP</span>, in the coming chapters, we will do a deep dive into this technology.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned why you need to have a security culture in an organization, and how it relates to and is supported by an information protection strategy. Then, we discussed what data classification means and why it builds the foundation of every data security solution. During the general overview of data classification, we looked at the relevance of a data classification scheme and related policies. Finally, we saw a Microsoft AIP solution overview, which builds the technology base for the information-protection solution we'll create in the coming chapters. Using the knowledge you gained in this chapter, you'll be able to define your own classification schemes, rules, and policies. Furthermore, you know which areas are critical in a security culture and you can include the appropriate tasks into your projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will dive into our first practical experience with AIP: identifying and detecting sensitive data.</p>
