- en: There are many bad ways to write a technical book. One simply rehashes the official
    documentation. Another walks the reader through a large and complex example, which
    doesn't necessarily do anything useful, except show how clever the author is.
    Yet another exhaustively sets out every available feature of the technology, and
    every possible way you can use them, without much guidance as to which features
    you'll really use, or which are best avoided.

    a paraphrase of the documentation: I can read it online. I also don''t want huge
    blocks of code for something that I don''t need to do. And I certainly don''t
    want an uncritical exposition of every single feature.'

    of how the tool works, in enough detail that I can get started using it straight
    away, but not so much detail that I get bogged down. I want to learn about features
    in the order in which I'm likely to use them, and I want to be able to start building
    something that runs and delivers business value from the very first chapters.

- en: That's what you can expect from this book. Whether you're a developer, a system
    administrator, or merely Puppet-curious, you're going to learn Puppet skills you
    can put into practice right away. Without going into lots of theory or background
    detail, I'll show you how to install packages and config files, create users,
    set up scheduled jobs, provision cloud instances, build containers, and so on.
    Every example deals with something real and practical that you're likely to need
    in your work, and you'll see the complete Puppet code to make it happen, along
    with step-by-step instructions for what to type and what output you'll see. All
    the examples are available in a GitHub repo for you to download and adapt.

    how it works, so that you can adapt it to your own purposes, and feel confident
    that you understand everything that's happened. By the end of the book, you will
    have all the skills you need to do real, useful, everyday work with Puppet, and
    there's a complete demo Puppet repository you can use to get your infrastructure
    up and running with minimum effort.

    administrators and developers who are looking to manage computer server systems
    for configuration management. No prior programming or system administration experience
    is assumed. However, if you have used Puppet before, you'll get a thorough grounding
    in all the latest features and modules, and I hope you'll still find plenty of
    new things to learn.
