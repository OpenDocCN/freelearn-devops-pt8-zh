- en: In this chapter, we will be focusing on delivering the **PaaS** (**Platform
    as a Service**) cloud offerings of Windows Azure Pack. PaaS enables tenants and
    organizations to develop, run, and manage their applications on the cloud provider's
    platform without worrying about the infrastructure layer, such as hardware or
    the operating system.

- en: In this chapter, we will be talking about two major PaaS offerings available
    in Windows Azure Pack, which includes WebSites and Service Bus. The WAP WebSite
    cloud can be used by organizations and cloud providers to deliver website hosting
    services to internal business lines and tenants. The WAP website cloud supports
    multiple programming languages, such as ASP.NET, PHP, and Node.js.

    for their website's development and management, whereas platform responsibility

    only. We will be focusing upon building a reliable platform, which is capable
    of hosting thousands of high density websites in a multi-tenant fashion. Any website
    development or programming will work in the same traditional web development service
    mechanism and won't be a part of the Windows Azure Pack Websites cloud.

    messaging service. This can be used by applications to pass messages or information.
