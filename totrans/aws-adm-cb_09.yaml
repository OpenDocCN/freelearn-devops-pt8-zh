- en: One of the hardest things to get used to when starting with AWS is that you
    pay for almost everything that you use. One of the biggest benefits of AWS is
    that you only pay for what you use. This makes it hard to quickly answer the *how
    much is it going to cost?* question that often arises when people first start
    using AWS; they don't know exactly what they currently use!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a *traditional* infrastructure or data center setup, many costs are paid
    during the initial outlay or in annual contracts. As AWS has no upfront fees,
    and few long-term commitments, so the usual thought process around costs is turned
    on its head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a number of helpful tools to get a better estimate of your AWS usage
    costs. Don't forget that every AWS service page has a pricing section. While some
    pricing models can be a bit confusing at the start, it quickly makes sense.

    estimate and forecast your AWS costs. By listing the resources you expect to consume
    you can calculate your pay-as-you-go costs, which is how AWS bills you—there's
    no upfront costs involved.

    the amount of data you will need to store. In AWS, you get charged for data in
    and out of AWS (for example, visitors to your website), but not between AWS services
    (for example, EC2 instances to RDS databases).

  prefs: []

    the `us-east-1` region is the cheapest, and also has the most services (not all
    services are available in all regions), so use that if you want to know the lowest-cost
    option. Other regions' prices vary due to supply and demand, cost of operations,
    and undoubtedly many other reasons that AWS doesn't go in to.

    value you give matches the required type for that parameter (for example, the
    `SubnetIds` value must be a list of values in this template).

  prefs: []

- en: If you made a reservation for a specific Availability Zone, AWS also provides
    you with a *capacity reservation*, which will give you some guarantees around
    the availability of instances in that zone. This is something you might want to
    consider if your workload needs to maintain a certain amount of capacity in the
    event of an entire Availability Zone outage, for example. An event such as this
    tends to cause a rush of new instance requests in the unaffected zones; however,
    customers without a capacity reservation may find their new instance requests
    can't be fulfilled because of a lack of capacity (this is not unheard of), causing
    them to miss out or forcing them to issue new instance requests for a different
    zone and/or instance type while at the same time crossing their fingers.

- en: The calculator will take your server requirements and map them to EC2 instances
    of an appropriate size. Since we've been specific that we need an object store
    for our storage, it will calculate our storage costs based on the price for S3
    storage in our region.

- en: The prices for our EC2 instances are based on a 3 year reserved instance price
    with a partial upfront payment. Is this a fair comparison? Yes and no. You would probably
    be locked in to a fixed hardware contract with your on-premise or co-located solution,
    so it makes sense to apply similar contract terms to your AWS pricing model. In
    reality, you'd probably want to think about purchasing reserved instances *after*
    you've moved to AWS and performed some fine tuning around which instance types
    to use. On the flip side, the AWS costs could be reduced even further if your
    servers ran under All Upfront instance reservations.

- en: The comparison of object storage systems may or may not be fair depending on
    the feature set of your on-premise or co-located solution. For example, S3 has
    the ability to apply an *infrequently accessed* storage class on stored objects,
    which reduces their cost but also (theoretically) slightly reduces their availability.
    You'd probably not have this feature in your on-premise or co-located storage.

- en: The 3 year cost for storage in our on-premise/co-located facility is AU $69,660,
    of which a whopping 97% of that is the *monthly cost to operate a rack*. This
    includes rental of space, cooling, power, and so on.

- en: While the cost calculator is taking a purely infrastructure view, it also does
    factor in support costs. If you are new to AWS, you will probably be leaning on
    AWS support a little bit to get up and running.

- en: You'll also want to factor in some costs around training and potentially hiring
    staff who are skilled in deploying and migrating systems to AWS. Your developers
    are also going to start thinking differently about how to build and deploy their
    applications. Make sure to factor this in too.
