<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">ML uses technology in order to find new trends and inculcate mathematical predictive models based on past factual data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">ML can help to solve complex problems such as the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">You may need to learn how to create complex code rules to make a decision; for example, if you want to recognize people’s emotions in images and speech, there are no easy ways to code the logic to achieve that.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">When you need to analyze a large amount of data for decision making and the volume of data is too large for a human to do this efficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">For example, while a human can do it with spam detection, the amount of data makes it impractical to do this quickly.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Relevant information may only become available dynamically when you need to adapt and personalize user behavior based on individual data; for example, with individualized product recommendations or website personalization.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">When many tasks with a lot of data are available, you cannot track the information fast enough to make a rule-based decision—for example, fraud detection and NLP.</span></li>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">The main idea</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1794"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> behind ML is to make available a training dataset to an ML algorithm and have it predict something from a new dataset, for example, feeding some historical stock market trend data to an ML model and having it predict how the market will fluctuate in the next six months to one year.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">When developing ML systems, it’s important to carefully combine data and code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">Both must come together in an organized manner and should evolve in a controlled way to build toward the common goal of a robust and scalable ML system.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">The data you use for training, testing, and making decisions with the ML system inference will change over time as data comes from different places. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">Your code also needs to change with data to accommodate data from various sources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">Without a systematic approach, there can be divergence in how code and data change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">This mismatch can cause problems when you try to use your ML system for real tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.5">It can also get in the way of smooth deployment, and lead to results that are hard to understand, trace, or repeat later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.6">There are various types of ML; let’s explore them.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-382"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Types of machine learning</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">ML helps </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1795"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">computers learn things without us needing to program every detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">It is like teaching computers to learn from experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">Imagine teaching your dog a trick: you show it what to do, and then it learns and does it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.4">With ML, computers can learn from data and then use this learning to make decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.5">Let’s look at the different ways computers can learn.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-383"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Supervised learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1796"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">supervised learning, the algorithm is given a set</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1797"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> of training examples where the data and target decisions are known. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">It can then predict the target value for new datasets containing the same attributes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.3">With this type of learning, the algorithm is taught using a dataset where input data comes with the correct answer or target. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.4">The algorithm learns to connect inputs with their correct outputs using these examples. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">This type of learning is often used for tasks where you need to classify things into categories or predict numbers, like in classification and regression tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">For example, it can be used to classify emails as spam or not spam or to predict the price of a house based on its features.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-384"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">Unsupervised learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1798"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">unsupervised learning, the algorithm is provided </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1799"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">with a massive volume of data and should discover patterns and relationships among the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">It can then draw inferences from datasets.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Human intervention is not required in unsupervised learning, for example, auto-classification of documents based on context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">It addresses the problem where correct output is unavailable for training examples, and the algorithm must find patterns in data using clustering.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">In unsupervised learning, a model is trained using an unlabeled dataset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">The algorithm works on its own to discover patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without any specific guidance or labeled examples to follow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">This type of learning is often applied to clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">News agencies or legal firms often deal with massive data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.5">Using unsupervised learning, they can automate document categorization, efficiently manage their digital repositories, and improve information retrieval processes, such as recommending similar articles or cases to readers or researchers.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-385"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Semi-supervised learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">This </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1800"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">approach mixes elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">It involves using a small amount of labeled data along with a more significant amount of unlabeled data to improve model performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when obtaining labeled data is either costly or takes a lot of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">It’s often used in scenarios where there’s a limited amount of labeled data, but plenty of unlabeled data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.5">Within the biomedical field, for example, semi-supervised learning can be very advantageous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.6">For instance, annotating medical images requires a lot of time and resources, making semi-supervised learning a practical solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.7">Models can be initially trained on a small set of labeled images and then fine-tuned using a more extensive set of unlabeled images, maximizing utility while minimizing costs and resources.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-386"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Reinforcement learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">This</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1801"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> type of learning involves training agents (or computer programs) to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1802"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">make a series of sequential decisions in a certain setting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">The goal is for the agent to learn the best actions to take in order to maximize a cumulative reward over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">Agents learn by taking action, receiving feedback (rewards or punishments), and adjusting their strategies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.4">Reinforcement learning is used in autonomous robotics, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), and recommendation systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.5">Autonomous vehicles employ reinforcement learning by navigating through traffic and adjusting actions based on the environment, thus ensuring optimal decision making in diverse scenarios. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.6">The vehicle makes sequences of decisions (like changing lanes, adjusting speed, etc.), receiving positive reinforcement for safe, efficient actions and negative reinforcement for undesirable actions.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-387"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Self-supervised learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">This is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1803"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">type of unsupervised learning where the algorithm generates labels or targets from the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">It often involves tasks like predicting missing parts of data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Self-supervised learning has gained popularity in NLP and computer vision for pre-training models on large datasets before fine-tuning specific tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">In image processing or computer vision, self-supervised learning can be employed to predict the next frame in a video sequence, thus facilitating models that understand movement and development within visual data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.5">Pre-training models in this manner and then fine-tuning them for specific tasks, like object detection, can yield impressive results.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-388"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Multi-instance learning</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">In</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1804"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1"> multi-instance learning, each data point is a bag containing multiple instances (sub-data points). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">The goal is to learn from bags of data while only having access to bag-level labels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">Multi-instance learning has applications in drug discovery, image classification, and content-based image retrieval. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">Considering e-commerce platforms, multi-instance learning could be employed to predict whether a user will purchase a product within a session (a bag), using various instances like page views, clicked products, and time spent on pages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">The bag-level label might indicate whether a purchase was made during that session, providing a robust basis for predictions and personalized content delivery.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">These </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1805"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">diverse learning paradigms, each with its own specialty and application area, make ML a versatile field, adaptable to various scenarios and challenges across industries and domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">By choosing a paradigm tailored to the specificities and available data of a given problem, ML practitioners can derive insightful models and facilitate intelligent, automated decision-making across applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">The key is to select a learning type that aligns best with the available data and the problem at hand, ensuring that models are both robust and applicable.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Data often has multiple issues, such as missing values, noise, bias, outliers, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Exploring the data makes us aware of this, providing us with necessary information on data quality and cleanliness, interesting patterns in the data, and likely paths forward once you start modeling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">Data science includes data collection, data preparation, analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Data preparation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1807"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1"> is the first step in building an ML model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">It is time consuming and constitutes up to 80% of the time spent on ML development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">Data preparation has always been considered tedious and resource intensive due to the inherent nature of data being “dirty” and not ready for ML in its raw form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.4">“Dirty” data could include missing or erroneous values and outliers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.5">Feature engineering is often needed to transform the inputs to deliver more accurate and efficient ML models.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">The first step in data preparation is to understand the business problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Data scientists are often eager to jump into the data directly, start coding, and produce insights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">However, without a clear understanding of the business problem, any insights you develop have a high chance of becoming a solution that cannot address the problem at hand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.4">It makes much more sense to start with a straightforward user story and business objectives before getting lost in the data.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1815"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">overfitting, your model needs to generalize, which means it should perform well not just on the data it was trained on (the training set) but also on new, unseen data (the test set or validation set). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">If a model is overfitting, it has essentially memorized the training data, capturing noise along with the underlying pattern, which leads to poor performance on any new data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">If a model shows high performance metrics on the training data but significantly lower metrics on the test data, it’s a sign of overfitting.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">The next step is to train and tune the model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">Let’s learn more about it.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-406"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Train and tune</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">To accelerate</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1881"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1"> the training process, it’s advisable to utilize a distributed compute cluster. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">This setup allows you to distribute the training workload across multiple computing resources, significantly speeding up the training phase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.3">By employing such a cluster, you can parallelize the computation, which means different parts of the training data can be processed simultaneously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.4">As a result, the model training completes faster, and the output, which your applications can utilize, becomes available sooner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.5">This approach not only enhances efficiency but also enables the handling of larger datasets, contributing to the development of more accurate and robust ML models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.6">Model tuning is also known as hyperparameter tuning, which is critical to achieving result accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">You need to find the most effective version of a model by running multiple training jobs on your dataset using the chosen algorithm and varying ranges of hyperparameters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">Following this, choose the correct hyperparameter values that yield a model that performs the best, as determined by a metric of your choice.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">While you are tuning the model, it’s crucial to have debugging capabilities that help capture real-time metrics during the training phase, such as training and validation accuracy, confusion matrices, and learning gradients. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">These metrics are essential for enhancing the accuracy of your model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.3">Additionally, it’s important to produce documentation to help improve model accuracy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.4">You need to capture the input parameters, configurations, and results and categorize them as different experiments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.5">This organization allows you to efficiently search for previous experiments by their characteristics, review previous experiments with their outcomes, and visually compare the results of various experiments to inform further adjustments and improvements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.6">Most managed ML platforms, such as Amazon SageMaker, provide these features for you.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Amazon SageMaker also provides Autopilot, a feature that automates several aspects of model development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">Autopilot examines raw data and applies feature processing techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.3">It then picks the most suitable algorithms, conducts training, tunes multiple models, and monitors their performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.4">The models are ranked based on their performance metrics.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">After finalizing your model, you need to deploy it and manage it in a production environment to gain valuable insights and achieve your desired outcomes.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-407"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">Deploy and manage</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">You must deploy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1882"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">your trained ML model into a production environment to enable real-time or batch data predictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">Implement auto-scaling for your ML instances across various locations to ensure high redundancy and establish a RESTful HTTPS endpoint for your application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">The application should be configured to have an API call to an ML endpoint to achieve low latency and high data processing speeds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.4">This architectural approach facilitates rapid integration of your new models into your application, streamlining the process because changes to the model do not necessitate modifications in the application’s code.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">Data is subject to rapid changes due to factors like seasonality or unforeseen events, making it essential to continuously monitor your model for both accuracy and ongoing relevance to your business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.2">A significant factor that can affect the accuracy of deployed models is if the data that is used for generating predictions differs from the training data used to train the model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.3">For instance, changing economic conditions could drive new interest rates, which in turn could impact home purchasing predictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.4">This phenomenon is known as concept drift, whereby the patterns and correlations a model was trained on no longer hold true in the current data environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.5">To address this, you need to automatically detect concept drift in deployed models, with detailed alerts that assist in pinpointing the exact source of the problem.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Model compatibility is another crucial factor during deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">Once a model has been built and trained using MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost, for example, you can choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, or ARM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">You need to compile your trained ML models to run optimally and efficiently in deploying compiled models to edge devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.4">This step ensures that your models not only deliver and provide high-performance and low-cost inference but also maintain cost effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">You should be able to run large-scale ML inference applications, which can include tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, NLP, personalization, and fraud detection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">As you progress through the different stages of building and deploying ML models, understanding how to fine-tune and adapt them for efficient deployment and operation becomes key, particularly for applications that require real-time processing and responsiveness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.3">Let’s look at a reference architecture to connect all components.</span></p>
