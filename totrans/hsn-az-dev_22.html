<li> Yes, App Service and Web App can be us<span>ed interchangeably.</span></li>
<li>Currently, we have three categories: <span class="packt_screen">Dev/Test</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Production</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Isolated</span>.</li>
<li>Both the <span class="packt_screen">Free </span>and <span class="packt_screen">Shared </span>tiers will be blocked after exceeding the computer limit, making the application unavailable for users.</li>
<li>Currently, we have five different providers: Azure AD, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft Account.</li>
<li>Yes, <span class="packt_screen">Premium </span>tiers are based on new Dv2 machines, which use more powerful CPUs and newer architecture.</li>
<li>You have to enable the <span class="packt_screen">Application logging</span><strong> </strong>feature.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, you cannot do it; you need at least the <span class="packt_screen">Shared </span>tier.</li>
<li>Yes, you can. App Service Plan<em> </em>can support more than only one App Service<em>.</em></li>
<li>There are three OSes available: <span class="packt_screen">Window</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Linux</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Docker</span>.</li>
<li>No, you cannot—you have to recreate App Service<em> </em>to change the underlying operating system.</li>
<li>Where can you find the proper location address? You can use either FTP or FTPS. You can find the location address on the <span class="packt_screen">Overview </span>blade.</li>
<li>User-level credentials will be set for all App Services<em> </em>in all subscriptions you have access to. App-level credentials are created with App Service creation and are attached to it.</li>
<li>Scaling up means setting up better servers. Scaling out means setting up more servers.</li>
<li>You will pay <span>$</span>50 per instance, so <span>$</span>500 in total.</li>
<li>Its purpose is to achieve better reliability and isolation of App Service. It <span>also </span>has higher limits regarding the maximum number of working instances.</li>
<li>Yes, it is—using Docker as the operating system.</li>

<li>Yes, it is possible to run WebJobs using the <span class="packt_screen">Free </span>or <span class="packt_screen">Shared </span>tier. However, it is not recommended as some jobs require that the <span class="packt_screen">Always On</span> <span>feature is </span>enabled, which is not possible for the <span class="packt_screen">Free</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Shared</span> tiers.</li>
<li>We can run a job either continuously or by triggering it manually/on schedule.</li>
<li>Yes, you can. In general, WebJobs supports the same programming languages as App Services.</li>
<li>You have can we deploy the <kbd>run.{extension}</kbd><strong> </strong>file. </li>
<li>If so, how to do that? Yes, you can; it is needed to archive all files as a ZIP package and deploy it.</li>
<li>It has to be created as a single instance.</li>
<li>Yes, WebJobs share application settings with App Services, which host them.</li>

<li>A cluster is the whole instance of Service Fabric<span>—</span>a container for all of the other concepts. An application is a logical container for multiple services, which serve the same purpose. A service is a single unit of work inside an application, which can be scaled according to need. A partition is an identifier that allows you to correctly distribute the load among services. A replica is a particular instance of a VM used to replicate the state or achieve higher durability of services.</li>

<li>No, the amount of available devices is different per tier.</li>
<li>Depending on your environment, either use Visual Studio or programmatically query the Notification Hub instance.</li>
<li>There are many possibilities: either use Azure Portal or Visual Studio or enable <span class="packt_screen">Test send</span> and send a notification programmatically.</li>

<li>Not really<span>—</span>while conceptually it could be possible, serverless services avoid scaling up.</li>
<li>Yes<span>—</span>if you scale out Azure App Service, the price for the service will be multiplied by the number of instances currently working.</li>
<li>In SF, scaling out is perfectly fine. The dangerous operations are scaling up as it requires you to take your workload from one place and migrate it to another one.</li>
<li>Manual scaling can be problematic when the traffic your application handles is dynamic<span>—</span>in that case, you would have to constantly monitor it and scale up/out when required.</li>
<li>You can set the auto-scaling feature and declare the CPU trigger for scaling your application.</li>

<li>Azure CDN is designed to cache to improve the performance of your application while serving static content to multiple users.</li>
<li>Currently, Azure CDN supports Verizon, Akamai, and Microsoft.</li>
<li>Origin is an endpoint that caches resources.</li>
<li>In Azure CDN, the compression feature allows you to compress files on the fly, reducing their size and network latencies.</li>
<li>The default TTL for files is set to seven days.</li>

<li>Supported routing methods are Performance, Weighted, Geographic, MultiValue, and Subnet.</li>
<li>To use the real user measurement feature, you have to inject a custom script into your website, which will send the updated values for latencies regarding network calls.</li>
<li>Of course<span>—</span>in that scenario, you will get a nested profile.</li>
<li>Yes, it is possible to use an external endpoint.</li>
<li>Once the DNS name is resolved (so that Azure Traffic Manager is pointed to the correct endpoint), a client connects directly with the endpoint.</li>
<li>Azure Traffic Manager works on the DNS level, while the gateway is a pattern that enables you to load balance requests, but acts as a single entry to your system.</li>
<li>Yes, you can use Azure Traffic Manager to achieve HA<span>—</span>in that scenario, you have to implement a profile, which enables you to failover to other regions if one fails to respond.</li>
