<p class="mce-root">Cloud technology is currently one of the most popular trends within the IT industry. Every day, a new company embarks on its journey with cloud computing, distancing itself from traditional on-premise setups, which have a tendency to hinder quick development and impede scaling operations. As the modern world requires us to adjust rapidly to changing expectations and dynamic workloads, knowledge of how to develop applications in the cloud is becoming more and more valuable.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You are holding in your hands a book that will guide you through the different capabilities and services of one of the most popular cloud offerings around—Microsoft Azure. We will focus mostly on <strong>Platform-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong><span>PaaS</span></strong>) components, which allow you to skip the cumbersome process of provisioning the infrastructure and focus directly on configuring various features and deploying your code, so that your application will be scalable, highly available, and resilient. The goal of each chapter is to give you a better understanding of multiple cloud patterns, connections, and integrations, so you can quickly start your very own project with an understanding of which Azure service you should use in this particular architecture.</p>

<p>This book is designed to act as a journey through different Azure PaaS offerings. It covers many basic and intermediate concepts of different services, an understanding of which is crucial when it comes to developing reliable and robust solutions based on the Microsoft cloud platform. The main audiences are developers and IT pros who have just started working with Azure, or who want to do so, and who are seeking a detailed guide to enable them to extend their cloud skills.</p>

<p>Activate your Azure subscription (whether a trial version, MSDN subscription feature, or a commercial one). </p>
<p><span>Since most of the examples are based on the .NET stack, some prior knowledge of this technology will make things easier for you, although, where possible, other technology stacks are also included, while a</span><span> basic understanding of HTTP concepts (such as the protocol or communication model) will be an advantage. A b</span><span>asic understanding of container-related topics will also be beneficial.<span> </span></span><span>More advanced topics and detailed instructions will often be included in the</span> <em>Further reading</em> <span>sections. Make sure you cover them all after finishing exercises from this book.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>In the </span><kbd>Main()</kbd><strong> </strong><span>method of your application, add the following code.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>using System;<br/><br/>namespace MyFirstWebJob<br/>{<br/>    class Program<br/>    {</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>            var config = new JobHostConfiguration();<br/>            <strong>config.UseTimers();</strong><br/><br/>            var host = new JobHost(config);</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>docker images</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "To do so, you have to right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">WebJobs</span> section of your Azure App Service and select <span class="packt_screen">Open in Portal</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
