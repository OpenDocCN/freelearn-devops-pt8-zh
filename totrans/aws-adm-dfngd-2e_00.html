            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The document comprises of two primary sections: a </span><kbd>Parameters</kbd><span> section, which contains a list of actions to be performed by the document, followed by a </span><kbd>mainSteps</kbd><span> section that specifies the action, which in this case is the </span><kbd>aws:configurePackage</kbd><span> to be performed by the document. In this case, the document when invoked will ask the user to select either </span><kbd>apache2</kbd><span>, </span><kbd>mysql-server</kbd><span>, or </span><kbd>php</kbd><span> from the dropdown list followed by an optional version number of the software you select.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>{ <br/>    "Effect": "Allow", <br/>    "Action": [ <br/>      "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:DeleteMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:FailMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:GetEndpoint", <br/>      "ec2messages:GetMessages", <br/>      "ec2messages:SendReply" <br/>    ], <br/>    "Resource": "*" <br/>}, </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>{ <br/>    <strong>"Effect": "Allow",</strong> <br/>    "Action": [ <br/>      "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:DeleteMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:FailMessage", <br/>      "ec2messages:GetEndpoint", <br/>      "ec2messages:GetMessages", <br/>      "ec2messages:SendReply" <br/>    ], <br/>    <strong>"Resource": "*"</strong> <br/>}, </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong># wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "In the <span class="packt_screen">Create Role</span> wizard, select the <span class="packt_screen">EC2</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">AWS service</span> role type, as shown in the following screenshot. Next, select the <span class="packt_screen">EC2</span> option as the <em>use case</em> for this activity and click on <span class="packt_screen">Next: Permissions</span> button to continue.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
