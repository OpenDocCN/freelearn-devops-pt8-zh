    to manage the sales process and activities. It enables salespeople to automate
    manual and repetitive tasks and provides them with information related to existing
    and prospective customers. In Salesforce CRM, Salesforce automation is known as

    to develop suitable campaigns in order to generate leads. Campaign management
    is carried out using Marketing Administration tools and has links to the lead,
    as well as any opportunities that have been influenced by the campaign.

    This can be the responsibility of either the marketing or sales teams and requires
    a suitable sales process to have been agreed upon. In Salesforce CRM, an account
    is the company or organization and a contact is an individual associated with
    an account.

    directly by the sales team. As described earlier in this book, the structure of
    Salesforce requires account ownership to be established - which sees inherited
    ownership of the opportunity. Account ownership is usually the responsibility
    of the sales team.

    stage is advanced to the point where they are set as Closed Won/Closed and represent

    we described the process from campaign to customer and beyond. We saw how leads
    in Salesforce CRM can be converted to generate the accounts, contacts, and opportunity
    records, which would then be processed through the sales cycle to form customer
    records, and we also saw how these customers can be supported by the customer
    service and support teams using the case management features.
  prefs: []

    marketing, sales, and customer service have to agree on roles and responsibilities
    for aspects of the business processes. We also looked at Salesforce **Chatter**,
    a collaboration application that helps in this respect by connecting people and
    sharing business information.

    can be extended further through the use of customization technologies, such as
    Visualforce, where you can leverage further benefits for your organization and
