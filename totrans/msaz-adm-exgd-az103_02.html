<p>This book will cover all the exam objectives for the AZ-103 exam. When relevant, we will provide you with extra information and further reading guidance about the different topics in this book.</p>
<p>The first chapter of this book will introduce the first objective, which is how to manage Azure subscriptions and resources. In this chapter, we are going to focus on assigning permissions for administrators so that they can manage your Azure subscriptions and resource groups. You will learn how to configure policies for your Azure subscriptions and resources in order <span>to stay compliant with your organizational standards and SLAs</span>. We are also going to set tagging on resource groups, and you'll learn how to configure cost center quotas and resource locks. To finish this chapter, we will cover how to move resources across different resource groups after creation, and how to completely remove resource groups from your Azure subscription.</p>
<p>In brief, the following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure subscriptions and resource groups</li>
<li>Assigning administrator permissions</li>
<li>Configuring Azure subscription policies</li>
<li>Implementing and setting tagging on resource groups</li>
<li><span>Configuring cost center quotas</span></li>
<li><span>Configuring resource</span><span> </span>locks</li>
<li class="">Moving resources across resource groups</li>

<p>Azure subscriptions are basically the billing accounts in Azure. Aside from billing, access to the Azure portal and the creation of the different Azure services in the portal are done through the use of Azure subscriptions. </p>
<p>If you look at the Azure account hierarchy, you will see where Azure subscriptions actually fit in. In the following diagram, the account hierarchy is shown:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bdbd9250-6f78-42dd-8935-b49805486ce8.png" style="width:43.00em;height:33.58em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Account hierarchy in Azure</div>
<p>It is divided into <strong><span class="packt_screen">Enterprise</span></strong>, <strong><span class="packt_screen">Department</span></strong>, <strong><span class="packt_screen">Accounts</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="packt_screen">Subscriptions</span></strong> levels. In the following overview, you'll get an idea of what these different levels are for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Enterprise</span></strong>: This is also called the <strong>Enterprise Agreement</strong>, and is only used by organizations. It can be accessed from a separate portal (<a href="https://ea.azure.com">https://ea.azure.com</a>) and is used <span>for the whole</span> <span>organization </span>to create the different departments.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Departments</span></strong>: At the department level, sub-accounts for the different departments in your organization are created. You can also group your departments in a functional way, like an IT and finance department, or group them in a geographical way, like North America and Europe, for instance. You can add a department owner here, which will be the person in charge of owning the budget for the department, for instance.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Accounts</span></strong>: This is where the different departments can create multiple accounts within their department. They can also add additional owners to manage these accounts. When you create a personal account in Azure, this is the starting point for creating the subscriptions. The Microsoft account that you use to log in to the Azure portal is then added to this account as the owner.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Subscriptions</span></strong>: You can create multiple subscriptions in an account. This is the level where the actual billing takes place and where the different Azure resources are created. You can add additional subscription owners that can manage the subscriptions, create the different resources, and assign other users to the subscription. Subscriptions always have a trust relationship with an Azure Active Directory instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the Azure subscription, you can create multiple resource groups. This will be covered in the next section.</p>

<p>Each resource that you create inside Azure must belong to a resource group. It is a logical container that groups multiple resources together. An example would be all the resources that share a similar life cycle, like all the different resources for a particular application; this can be a virtual machine, an Azure Database, a virtual network in Azure, and more, grouped inside the same resource group. They can then be managed and deleted as<span> a single entity.</span></p>

<p>There are two ways to assign administrator permissions to your users. The first is done inside Azure Active Directory and is used to assign global administrator permissions. The second is done by using <strong>role-based access control</strong> (<strong>RBAC</strong>) and can be set from the subscription level.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we'll look at both possibilities.</p>

<p>With global administrator permissions, you can manage all subscriptions and management groups. A management group provides a level of scope above permissions and can be used to manage multiple subscriptions together.</p>
<p>When a user is assigned to the global administrator role, it is able to see all Azure subscriptions and management groups in an organization, allow an automation app to access all Azure subscriptions and management groups, regain access to an Azure subscription or management group when a user has lost access, and grant another user (or themselves) access to an Azure subscription or management group.</p>
<p><span>To assign administrator permissions to a user on the subscription level, take the following steps:</span></p>

<p>With Azure Policy, you can create, assign, and manage policies. These policies can be used so that you stay compliant with your corporate standards and SLAs by enforcing different rules and effects over your Azure resources. Your resources are evaluated by the assigned policies for non-compliance. For instance, you can create a policy that only allows virtual machines from a certain SKU size in your environment. When this policy is assigned, all new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance with this policy.</p>
<p>To configure subscription policies, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by open</span><span>ing </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the left-hand menu, select <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Subscriptions</strong></span> (this is if you added it to your favorites; otherwise, take the steps that we described in the previous demonstration).</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In the <span class="packt_screen">Subscriptions</span> overview blade, in the left-hand menu under <strong><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span></strong>, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Policies</span></strong>:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Creating a new policy<br/></span></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>On the next screen, we're going to create a definition for our policy. Add the following values to create the policy so that resources for this subscription can only be created in selected regions:
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Scope</span></strong>: The subscription name.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Exclusions</span></strong>: Leave this blank; we are going to create a policy that applies to the entire subscription.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Policy definition</span></strong>: When you select this, you can choose from a number of available policies that you can apply to your subscription. Microsoft has created these JSON templates for you, based on the best practices from different enterprises. You can create your own templates here as well. Select a policy from the list (for instance, <span class="packt_screen">Allowed locations</span>), and then click<span class="packt_screen"> <strong>Select</strong></span>.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Assignment name</span></strong>: This is automatically filled in after selecting the policy.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Parameters</span></strong>: Here, you can select the allowed locations where users can deploy their resources. For instance, select <span class="packt_screen">Central US</span>, <span class="packt_screen">East US</span>, <span><span class="packt_screen">East US</span> <span class="packt_screen">2</span>, </span><span class="packt_screen">West US</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">West US 2</span>. </li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Assigning a new policy</div>
<p>After applying this policy, resources for this subscription can only be created in the selected regions. If you want to add additional regions or remove regions from this policy, you can edit this later.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can apply policies at the resource group level as well. This works exactly the same as adding policies at the subscription level.

<p><span>You can apply tags to all of your Azure resources. This way, you add extra metadata to the resource group, which can be used to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For instance, you can set the name to <kbd>Environment</kbd> and the value to <kbd>Demo</kbd>, or you can set the name to <kbd>Maintenance Window</kbd> and the value to <kbd>Saturday 9 AM</kbd>. After applying these tags, you can easily retrieve all the resources with the same tag name and value. This can be a useful feature for billing or management purposes.</span></p>
<p>For billing based on your tags, you can use the assigned tags to group the billing for certain resources; for example, if you run VMs and databases for different environments (test, pre-production, and production), you can use tags to categorize the costs. These tags will then show up in the different cost reporting views. For instance, they are visible in the cost analysis view immediately after they are created, and in the detail usage <kbd>.csv</kbd> after the first billing period.</p>
<p><span>You can </span>create resource groups in Azure using the Azure portal, PowerShell, and the CLI. In this demonstration, we are going to create an Azure resource group in our subscription from the Azure portal. You can also set tagging on the resource group level, so we are going to do that, as well. Therefore, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by open</span><span>ing </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>

<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Name</span></strong>: <kbd>PacktResourcegroup</kbd>.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Region</span></strong>: Keep the default (<span class="packt_screen">Central US</span>, in my case). You can also select another region, if you prefer.</li>

<p>We have now created a new resource group and applied a tag to it. You can also manage your tags from the <span class="packt_screen">Tags</span> blade of the resource group. In the next section, we're going to look at how to configure cost center quotas.</p>

<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">CanNotDelete</span></strong>: This level prevents authorized users from deleting the resource. They can still read and modify the resource.</li>
<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">ReadOnly</span></strong>: Within this level, authorized users can read a resource, but they cannot delete or update it. This level is similar to assigning all authorized users to the reader role using RBAC.</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply a lock on your resource group, you have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by open</span><span>ing </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the left-hand menu, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Resource groups</span></strong>. Select the resource group that we created in the previous demonstration.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Resource Group</span> overview blade, under <strong><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span></strong><span>, select </span><strong><span class="packt_screen">Locks</span></strong>:</li>
</ol>

<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Resource group overview</span><strong><br/></strong></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>On the next screen, click <strong><span class="packt_screen">Add</span></strong> in the top menu to create a new lock for this resource. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">

<li><strong><span class="packt_screen">Name</span></strong>: <kbd>No-Deletion</kbd></li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong><span class="packt_screen">Lock type</span></strong>: <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>:</li>

<p>You can easily move your resources across different resource groups and subscriptions by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, the CLI, and the REST API. During the move operation, both the source group and the target group are locked. This blocks all write and delete operations on the resource group until the movement is complete. This means that you cannot update, add, or delete resources in the resource group, but the resources aren't frozen. There will be no downtime for these resources. However, the location of the resources will remain the same, even when the new resource group is created in a different location.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">There are limitations for moving resources across different resource groups and subscriptions. For instance, a VM with managed disks that is deployed inside an availability zone cannot be moved. For more information about these limitations, you can refer to the following article: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources</a>.</div>
<p>In the following demonstration, we are going to move resources from a resource group to another resource group using the Azure portal. For this demonstration, I've added a VM to this resource group and created a new resource group called <kbd>PacktResourceGroup1</kbd>. To move this VM, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by open</span><span>ing </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the left-hand menu, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Resource groups</span></strong>. <span>Select</span> the <kbd>PacktResourceGroup</kbd><strong> </strong><span>that we created in the previous demonstration. Select all the VM resources from the list, and in the top menu, select </span><strong><span class="packt_screen">Move</span></strong>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/50223921-da26-4ef2-aef7-ccebe1995c90.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Moving resources<strong><br/></strong></div>
<ol start="3">
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You have two possibilities: <strong><span class="packt_screen">Move to another resource group</span></strong> and <strong><span class="packt_screen">Move to another subscription</span></strong>. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Move</span> <span class="packt_screen">to another resource group</span>, and in the next screen, select <kbd>PacktResourceGroup1</kbd> as the resource group, and check the checkbox underneath:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/59d1a2e7-4988-43a7-a1eb-f1baec14c706.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Moving resources</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on <strong><span class="packt_screen">OK</span></strong> to move the resources to the other resource group.</li>
</ol>
<p>After moving the resources, you can open the overview blade of <kbd>PacktResourceGroup1</kbd><span>. Y</span>ou will see that all the resources have been moved. </p>
<p>In the next (and final) section of this chapter, we are going to remove the resource group.</p>

<p>In this chapter, <span><span>we introduced the various aspects of Azure subscriptions and resource groups. We assigned administrator permissions and described how to create policies to stay compliant. We also covered cost center<span> quotas and resource </span>locks. At the end of this chapter, we moved and removed resource groups completely.</span></span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll cover the second part of this exam objective by describing how to analyze resource utilization and consumption.</p>
