- en: OpenStack is open source software for building public and private clouds as
    well as privately hosted software defined infrastructure services. In the fall
    of 2017, the OpenStack Foundation released the 16th version of OpenStack, known
    as Pike, to the public. Since its introduction as an open source project in 2010
    by NASA and Rackspace, OpenStack has undergone significant improvements in its
    features and functionality thanks to developers and operators worldwide. Their
    hard work has resulted in production-ready cloud software that powers workloads
    of all sizes throughout the world.

- en: In 2012, the Folsom release of OpenStack introduced a standalone networking
    component known then as Quantum. Long since renamed Neutron, the networking component
    of OpenStack provides cloud operators and users with an API used to create and
    manage network resources in the cloud. Neutron's extensible framework allows for
    third-party plugins and additional network services, such as load balancers, firewalls,
    and virtual private networks, to be deployed and managed.

- en: As an architect and operator of hundreds of OpenStack-based private clouds since
    2012, I have seen much of what OpenStack has to offer in terms of networking capabilities.
    In this book, I have condensed what I feel are its most valuable and production-ready
    features to date. Throughout this book, we will take a look at a few common network
    and service architectures and lay a foundation for deploying and managing OpenStack
    Networking that can help you develop and sharpen your skills as an OpenStack cloud
    operator.

- en: This book is geared towards OpenStack cloud administrators or operators with
    a novice to intermediate level of experience in managing OpenStack-based clouds
    who are looking to build or enhance their cloud using the networking service known
    as Neutron. By laying down a basic installation of OpenStack based on the upstream
    documentation found at [docs.openstack.org](http://docs.openstack.org), the reader
    should be able to follow the examples laid out in the book to obtain a functional
    understanding of the various components of OpenStack Networking using open source
    reference architectures.

- en: This book assumes a moderate level of networking experience, including experience
    with Linux networking configurations as well as physical switch and router configurations.
    While this book walks the reader through a basic installation of OpenStack, little
    time is spent on services other than Neutron. Therefore, it is important that
    the reader has a basic understanding of OpenStack and its general configuration
    prior to configuring OpenStack networking.
