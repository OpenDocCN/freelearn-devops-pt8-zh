<p>Well, to the uninitiated, <strong>IoT</strong> or <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is all about connecting everyday <em>objects</em> or <em>things</em> together, using a common medium of communication (in this case, the internet) for exchange of data. I know it doesn't sound much, but today, IoT is practically being implemented everywhere around us; from wearable devices, smartphones, home appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, to vehicles and heavy machinery, and much more! Gartner predicts that by the year 2020, there will be an estimated 26 billion devices connected using IoT, and this number is set to grow even further, as IoT adoption becomes mainstream. But what exactly is IoT and how do you build it? Here's a quick look at some of the basic building blocks required in order to get started with IoT:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img style="font-size: 1em" height="381" width="1163" src="Images/9e46e079-ca97-461d-8770-befa37c53f0c.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Things</strong>: To begin with, any form of IoT comprises end user devices that we use or leverage to perform some of our day-to-day tasks. These devices, or things, can be anything and everything, including simple electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables, alarm clocks, light bulbs, to washing machines, garage doors, vehicles, ships, and the list just goes on!</li>
<li><strong>Sensors</strong>: Sensors are devices that can be incorporated within things that are used to capture or supply our data. Some of the most commonly used sensors are IR sensors, moisture sensors, gas and pressure sensors, and so on. Sensors are not designed to process data on their own. They simply collect and push the data out to one or more processors. For example, a light sensor monitoring whether a light bulb is switched on or off, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Processors</strong>: Processors are the brains of the IoT system. Their main function is to process the data that is captured by the sensors. This processing can be based on certain triggers or can be performed close to real time, as well. A single processor can be used to connect and process data from multiple sensors, as well. The most commonly used type of processors include microcontrollers, embedded controllers, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Gateways</strong>: Gateways are special devices that are responsible for collecting and routing data, processed by one or more processors, to IoT applications for further analysis. A gateway can collect, aggregate, and send data over the internet, either as streams or in batches, depending on its configuration and connectivity options.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Once data from various gateways is collected, it needs to be further analyzed to form meaningful insights, so that appropriate actions on the respective operation can be performed. This can be achieved by leveraging one or more applications, such as an industrial control hub, or even a home automation system. For example, an application can be used to remotely trigger a light bulb to switch on, once the ambient light in the room starts to fade, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this essential information in mind, let's look at a few key AWS services you can use to get started with your very own IoT on the cloud.</p>

<p>AWS has vastly enhanced its IoT suite of services, ever since its first inception towards the end of 2015. Here is a brief explanation of what it offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Core</strong>: The AWS IoT Core is a managed service that allows you to securely connect and interact with billions of IoT devices, without having to bother about setting up or managing any underlying infrastructure. You can use the IoT Core service to build IoT applications, using a combination of various AWS services as well, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Elasticsearch, Amazon machine learning, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Device Management</strong>: The AWS IoT Device Management service allows you to register, organize, and manage a large number of IoT devices, easily. You can use this service to on-board devices in bulk and then manage them all, using a single pane of glass view.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Greengrass</strong>: AWS Greengrass is a software service designed to execute Lambda functions locally, on your IoT devices. In addition to this, you can also use Greengrass to sync data between the device and the IoT Core, using data caching along with other functionalities, such as ML inference, messaging, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong>: Connecting and managing billions of IoT devices is one task, and querying the large IoT data set is quite another. AWS IoT Analytics is a completely managed service that allows you to run analytics on extremely large volumes of IoT data, without having to configure or manage an underlying analytics platform. Using this service, you obtain better insights on your devices, as well as build resilient IoT applications.</li>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Button</strong>: The AWS IoT Button is a Wi-Fi enabled, programmable button which enables you to write and integrate an IoT application, without having to know about any device-specific code.</li>
<li><strong>AWS IoT Device Defender</strong>: With so many devices to manage and maintain, it is equally important to safeguard the devices against malicious attacks. AWS IoT Device Defender is a managed service that allows you to secure, manage, and audit remote devices against a set of security rules and policies. If any deviations are found, IoT Device Defender triggers appropriate notifications for them.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong>: Amazon FreeRTOS is a custom operating system built specifically for small, low-powered edge devices or microcontrollers. The operating system is based on the FreeRTOS kernel and helps to easily connect and manage devices with the AWS IoT service.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we come to the end of this section. In the next section, we will learn a bit about the AWS IoT Core service in detail, along with a simple and easy-to-follow getting started guide.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with AWS IoT Core</h1>
                </header>

<p>With a brief understanding of the AWS IoT suite of services covered, we can now dive deep into the world of the AWS IoT Core! However, before we get started with some actual hands-on projects, here is a quick look at some important AWS IoT Core concepts and terminologies:</p>
<p>The AWS IoT Core service provides bidirectional communication between devices and the AWS cloud, using a set of components described in the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device gateway</strong>: This provides a secure mechanism for the IoT device to communicate with the AWS IoT service.</li>
<li><strong>Device shadow</strong>: A device shadow is a persistent representation of your IoT device on the cloud. A JSON-based document stores the current state of your device, which you can use to sync with the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Message broker</strong>: The message broker provides a secure and reliable channel, using which the IoT device can communicate with the cloud. The broker is based on a publisher–subscriber model and can be used to leverage either the standard MQTT protocol, or the advanced MQTT over WebSockets for communication.</li>
<li><strong>Registry</strong>: Registry is a service that is used to securely register your IoT device with the cloud. You can use the registry to associate certificates and MQTT client IDs with your devices.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong>: Groups are logical containers used to group together similar devices in order to effectively manage them. You can use groups to propagate permissions and perform bulk actions on your connected devices.</li>
<li><strong>Rules</strong>: The rules engine service in AWS IoT Core provides a mechanism which enables you to process IoT data using simple SQL queries. You can additionally write rules that can integrate AWS IoT Core with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how it all fits together! You start off by preparing a device for connection with the AWS IoT Core. This involves creating a set of certificates that essentially authenticates the device when it connects to the AWS IoT Core. Once connected, the device starts publishing its current state in a JSON format using the standard MQTT protocol. These messages are sent to the message broker, which essentially routes them to their respective subscribing clients, based on the message's topic.</p>
<p>You can even create one or more rules to define a set of actions based on the data contained within the messages. When a particular data matches the configured expression, the rules engine invokes that particular action, which can be anything from sending the data to a file in Amazon S3 to processing the data using AWS Lambda or Amazon Kinesis. The following is a representation of these components put together:</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, let's look at how you can connect your IoT device with the AWS IoT Core!</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Connecting a device to AWS IoT Core</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AWS IoT supports a wide variety of specialized IoT-embedded devices and microcontrollers that you can connect to. However, for simplicity, you can also simulate an IoT device using either a locally set up virtual machine or an EC2 instance, as well. For this section, we will be using a simple Ubuntu-based virtual machine, hosted using VirtualBox. The virtual machine has the basic operating system packages installed in it and runs off a 512 MB RAM and 1 CPU core allocation with a 10 GB disk. Ensure that your virtual machine has an open internet connectivity and a valid hostname set, before you proceed with any further steps.</p>
<p>The following list demonstrates the simulated IoT device's configuration for your reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 1 CPU</li>
<li><strong>RAM</strong>: 512 MB</li>
<li><strong>Operating System</strong>: Ubuntu Server 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial) x86_64 architecture</li>
<li><strong>Packages</strong>: Core server packages along with <kbd>vim</kbd>, <kbd>node</kbd>, <kbd>npm</kbd>, <kbd>git</kbd>, <kbd>wget</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the device or virtual machine is prepped, we are good to connect with the AWS IoT Core:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the AWS Management Console, filter and select the <span class="packt_screen">AWS IoT</span> service using the <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> provided. Alternatively, select this URL, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home</a> to launch the AWS IoT console.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Get started</span> option to continue.</li>
<li>Once logged into the console, select the <span class="packt_screen">Onboard</span> option from the navigation pane on the left-hand side of the console. Here, you can opt to get started with configuring your first device with the IoT service as well as other options, such as configuring the <span class="packt_screen">AWS IoT Button</span> or getting started with the <span class="packt_screen">AWS IoT Starter Kit</span>. For this section, select the <span class="packt_screen">Get started</span> option under the <span class="packt_screen">Configure a device</span> section.</li>
<li>The <span class="packt_screen">Get started</span> option is a simple three-step process that involves first registering your device, followed by downloading a set of credentials and SDKs for the device to communicate with the IoT Core, and finally testing to check whether the device is successfully connected or not.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Linux/OSX</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Choose a platform</span> option followed by <span class="packt_screen">Node.js</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Choose a AWS IoT Device SDK,</span> as shown in the following screenshot. Note here, you can alternatively select the <span class="packt_screen">Java</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Python</span> SDKs as well; however, the rest of this particular use case will be based only upon Node.js:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="264" width="681" src="Images/493f49f8-101a-4741-87f7-45fbf07a9b18.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Once the appropriate platform and IoT SDK are selected, click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to continue.</li>
<li>The next step involves the registration of a <em>thing</em> or in our case, the IoT device itself. Start off by providing a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> for your thing and then select the <span class="packt_screen">Show optional configuration</span> option.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Apply a type to this thing</span> section, select the <span class="packt_screen">Create type</span> option. A <span class="packt_screen">Thing Type</span> simplifies managing IoT devices by providing a consistent registry data for things that share a particular type. Provide a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and an optional <span class="packt_screen">Description</span> for your <span class="packt_screen">Thing Type</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Create thing type</span> when done.</li>
<li>Here's what the final configuration should look like. In my case, I've created a <span class="packt_screen">Thing Type</span> called <span class="packt_screen">dummyIoTDevice</span> for logically classifying all virtual machine-based IoT devices together. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Create Thing</span> option once completed:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7c818630-e6ae-49d7-9284-172aaf633f5e.png" width="805" height="348"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>With the thing successfully created, we now need to establish the connection between the thing and AWS IoT Core. To do so, select the newly created thing tile from the <span class="packt_screen">Things</span> console to view the thing's various configurations. Among the important options is the <span class="packt_screen">Security</span> option. Go ahead and select the <span class="packt_screen">Security</span> option from the navigation pane.</li>
<li>Here, you can create and associate the necessary certificates, as well as policies that will be required for <span class="packt_screen">Thing</span> to communicate with the IoT Core. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Create certificate</span> option to begin with.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>The necessary certificates are created automatically by AWS Core. Download these files and save them in a safe place. Certificates can be retrieved at any time, but the private and public keys <em>cannot be retrieved</em> after you close this page:
<ul>
<li><strong>A certificate for this thing</strong>: <kbd>xyz.cert.pem</kbd></li>
<li><strong>A public key</strong>: <kbd>xyz.public.key</kbd></li>
<li><strong>A private key</strong>: <kbd>xyz.private.key</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">In addition, you will need to download the <em>root CA</em> for AWS IoT from Symantec. You can do that by selecting the following URL:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><a href="https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem">https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Remember to select the <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span> option to successfully activate the keys. Once done, select the <span class="packt_screen">Attach a policy</span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="354" width="596" src="Images/8098dee5-61d5-4d1e-89d9-43fde4e26c44.png"/></div>
<ol start="13">
<li>Since this is our first time working with the IoT Core, we will be required to create a new policy from scratch. The policy will be used to authorize the certificates we created in the previous step. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Create new policy</span> option to get started.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Create a Policy</span> page, start by providing a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> for your new policy. Once completed, you can use either the <em>basic</em> or <em>advanced</em> mode to create your IoT policy. For simplicity, select the <span class="packt_screen">Advanced mode</span> option and paste the following policy snippet as shown:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">{<br/>  "Version": "2012-10-17",<br/>  "Statement": [<br/>  {<br/>    "Effect": "Allow",<br/>    "Action": "iot:*",<br/>    "Resource": "*"<br/>  }<br/>  ]<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">The following policy grants all devices permission to connect, publish, and subscribe to the AWS IoT message broker. You can alternatively tweak this policy as per your requirements, as well.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Once done, select the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> option to complete the policy creation process.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">With this step completed, we are but a few steps away from establishing the connection between our IoT device and the AWS IoT Core.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>With the necessary policy created and the certificates downloaded, we now need to copy these to our IoT device, in this case the Ubuntu virtual machine. You can use any SCP tool to perform this activity, such as WinSCP, as well. Here is a screenshot of the files on my Ubuntu virtual machine:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="213" width="799" src="Images/0ac44f49-056f-4701-94b6-b235a3b9470e.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_infobox">For this scenario, I've called the downloaded Symantec Root CA file  <kbd>root-CA.crt</kbd>.</div>
<p>Once the files are copied over to a destination folder in your IoT device, you are now ready to test the connectivity, but in order to do that, we will first need to install and configure the AWS IoT Device SDK on our IoT device.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with AWS IoT Device SDK</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The AWS IoT Device SDK is a quick and easy way to connect your IoT devices with AWS IoT Core. To date, AWS provides IoT Device SDKs for Node.js, Java, Python, and Embedded C. For this particular section, we will be connecting our dummy IoT device with AWS IoT, using the Node.js SDK.</p>
<p>Before we get things started, ensure that you have the latest versions of node and NPM installed and running on your device. Since we are simulating an IoT device using an Ubuntu virtual machine, you can use the following commands to install and verify node and NPM versions:</p>
<pre><strong># sudo apt-get update 
# sudo apt-get install nodejs npm 
# node -v &amp;&amp; npm -v</strong> </pre>
<p>Once the required packages are installed, we now need to install the AWS IoT Device SDK itself. Type in the following command as shown:</p>
<pre><strong># npm install aws-iot-device-sdk</strong> </pre>
<p>With the SDK installed, we can now begin testing the connectivity with a simple Node.js program. Copy and paste the following code snippet in a new <kbd>.js</kbd> file on your IoT device:</p>
<pre># vi test1.js 
//Connection parameters 
var awsIot = require('aws-iot-device-sdk'); 
var device = awsIot.device({ 
   keyPath: '&lt;PATH_TO_PRIVATE.PEM.KEY&gt;', 
  certPath: '&lt;PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE.PEM&gt;CRT&gt;', 
    caPath: 'root-CA.crt', 
  clientId: '&lt;THING_NAME&gt;', 
    region: '&lt;REGION&gt;', 
      host: '&lt;IoT_DEVICE_REST_API_ENDPOINT&gt;' 
}); 
//Connection parameters end 
 
//Device Object 
device 
.on('connect', function () { 
console.log('Yaaa! We are connected!'); 
}); </pre>
<p>What does the code do? Well for starters, the first section of the code is simply where you pass the required private key and certificates downloaded from the earlier steps, along with a few other configuration items, such as the <kbd>clientId</kbd>, the AWS <kbd>region</kbd> where the IoT Core is set up and finally, the <kbd>host,</kbd> which is basically a unique REST API endpoint for your device. You can find this endpoint by selecting your newly created IoT device from the AWS IoT dashboard and selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Interact</span> tab, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8b80713b-4516-4f4f-9b91-582c38712d6c.png" width="779" height="285"/></div>
<p>The second part of the code is where we use the configured parameters to actually connect to the AWS IoT Core. If the connection is successful, it will print a simple message as shown. To run the code, simply type in the following command:</p>
<pre><strong># node test1.js</strong> </pre>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="103" width="507" src="Images/de4561d2-d354-4989-8a55-eafc1acbc8e7.png"/></div>
<p>With the device now successfully connecting with the AWS IoT Core, let's look at a few other examples that you can use to interact with the message broker service. To start off, let's see how we can use the AWS IoT Device SDK to subscribe to a topic and print back any message that gets published to it.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following code snippet below the connection parameters:</p>
<pre># vi test2.js 
//Connnection parameters 
. . . . . 
//Connection parameters end 
 
//Device Object 
device 
.on('connect', function () { 
console.log('Yaaa! We are connected!'); 
device.subscribe('Topic0'); 
console.log('Subscribed to Topic'); 
}); 
 
device 
.on('message', function (topic, payload) { 
console.log('Received following message: ', topic, payload.toString()); 
}); </pre>
<p>The following code subscribes the device to a topic named <kbd>Topic0</kbd>. Once the subscription is completed, the code will display any message that is published to it.</p>
<p>With the code in place, save the file and run the program using the following code:</p>
<pre><strong># node test2.js</strong> </pre>
<p>Next, let us look at how we can publish a message to the newly created topic:</p>
<ol>
<li>To publish a message to the following topic, we will use the MQTT client provided by AWS IoT Core itself. To do so, from the AWS IoT Core dashboard, select the <span class="packt_screen">Test</span> option from the navigation pane.</li>
<li>Using the MQTT client, you can subscribe, as well as publish, to a topic. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Publish to topic</span> option.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> section, provide the topic name (in this case, <kbd>Topic0</kbd>) where you want to publish the message and click on <span class="packt_screen">Publish to topic,</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/150d1d2b-2bec-4a4d-8c76-0fe48da70bea.png" width="718" height="185"/></div>
<p>Check the device Terminal for the corresponding message. You should see the following output:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="178" width="487" src="Images/d153c3ef-657d-440b-ab92-12637f86dbd4.png"/></div>
<p>With the device now able to subscribe to a topic, you can also get the device to publish a message to a topic as well.</p>
<p>Once again, create a new file and copy-paste the following code snippet below the connection parameters:</p>
<pre># vi test3.js 
//Connnection parameters 
. . . . . 
//Connection parameters end 
 
//Device Object 
device 
.on('connect', function () { 
console.log('Yaaa! We are connected!'); 
device.subscribe('Topic0'); 
console.log('Subscribed to Topic'); 
var msg = "Hello from IoT Device!"; 
      device.publish('Topic0', msg); 
      console.log ("Publishing message: "+msg); 
}); 
 
device 
.on('message', function (topic, payload) { 
console.log('Received following message: ', topic, payload.toString()); 
}); </pre>
<p>As you can see from the following code, we have simply added a <kbd>publish()</kbd> method that will publish a custom message to a pre-defined topic, in this case, <kbd>Topic0</kbd>.</p>
<p>Save the code and run the program using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong># node test3.js</strong> </pre>
<p>You should get the following output from the device Terminal:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="151" width="665" src="Images/bc6e92e4-6c9a-443e-9a96-fa94a3cd52b7.png"/></div>
<p>Simple, isn't it! You can use the same concepts on a real IoT device as well, with only a few minor changes here and there. Here is an example code snippet that you can use to generate dummy data and publish the data to an MQTT topic.</p>
<p>Create a new file and paste the following code snippet below the connection parameters, as done throughout this section:</p>
<pre># vi test4.js 
//Connnection parameters 
. . . . . 
//Connection parameters end 
 
var uuid = require('node-uuid'); 
var numbers = new Array(10); 
function getRandomInt(min, max) { 
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; 
} 
 
device 
.on('connect', function () { 
console.log('Yaaa! We are connected!'); 
device.subscribe('Topic0'); 
console.log('Subscribed to Topic'); 
 
for (var i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) 
    { 
  for (var j = 0; j &lt; numbers.length; j++) 
     { 
       numbers[i] = getRandomInt(0,1); 
       uuid[i] = uuid.v4() 
      } 
      var msg = "{"uuid":"" + uuid[i] + """ + "," +"""+ "state":" + numbers[i]+"}"; 
      device.publish('Topic0', msg); 
      console.log ("Publishing message: "+uuid[i],numbers[i]); 
   } 
 
}); 
 
device 
.on('message', function (topic, payload) { 
console.log('Received following message: ', topic, payload.toString()); 
}); </pre>
<p>The following code snippet leverages the <kbd>node-uuid</kbd> module to randomly generate long strings of UUIDs. With each UUID record generated, a corresponding random value of either <kbd>0</kbd> or <kbd>1</kbd> is printed which denotes the <em>state</em> of the UUID. You can control the number of records generated by adjusting the value of the array object. By default, the following code will publish 10 records in a proper JSON to the MQTT topic, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
<pre>{ 
"uuid":"357d6212-3444-4f55-9784-93a265905289", 
"state":0 
} 
{ 
"uuid":"ad8cb61b-f29d-4a84-a7eb-42633dd3a3c2", 
"state":0 
} 
. . . . .  
{ 
"uuid":"19492c45-0cf7-4468-b275-5b7b1bdf3a64", 
"state":1 
} </pre>
<p>Once the code is in place, simply execute it using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong># node test4.js</strong> </pre>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the most fascinating features recently provided with the AWS IoT Core is IoT rules. With IoT rules, you can basically provide your connected devices with the ability to interact with other AWS services. IoT rules provide a predefined set of rules that allow you to perform a variety of tasks, such as those listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write data received from a device to an Amazon DynamoDB table</li>
<li>Send a push notification to all users using Amazon SNS</li>
<li>Publish data to an Amazon SQS queue</li>
<li>Invoke a Lambda function to perform some data transformation</li>
<li>Process data from devices using Amazon Kinesis, and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>An IoT rule also provides you with an added functionality which enables you to query and filter device data, as well use simple SQL commands. Based on the SQL statement execution, you can then either invoke a success or an error action:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get started with IoT rules, select the <span class="packt_screen">Act</span> option from the AWS IoT Core console. Since this is our first time, click on <span class="packt_screen">Create a rule</span> to proceed with the next steps.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Create a rule</span> page, start off by providing a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and a <span class="packt_screen">Description</span> for your rule. In this scenario, we will be creating an IoT rule that will write all device data to a DynamoDB table.</li>
<li>Next, from the <span class="packt_screen">Using SQL version</span> drop-down list, select an appropriate SQL version for this rule. By default, the <span class="packt_screen">2016-03-23</span> will be selected.</li>
<li>Next, we form the <span class="packt_screen">Rule query statement</span>. This is used to filter out particular messages from a large set of device data. In this case, we want all the data from our demo device to be written to a DynamoDB table, so in the <span class="packt_screen">Attribute</span> field, type in an <kbd>*</kbd> which indicates all fields followed by a valid topic name in the <span class="packt_screen">Topic filter</span> option. You can also set an optional <span class="packt_screen">Condition</span> to match your query.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Here's what the final query should look like:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="390" width="473" src="Images/63f3f87e-88f1-4ed3-816f-e76cfc550c63.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>With the query in place, the next step is to associate one or more actions with your IoT rule. From the <span class="packt_screen">Set one or more actions</span> section, select the <span class="packt_screen">Add action</span> option to get started.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Select an action</span> page, you can browse and select one of the predefined action templates. In this case, we will be selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Insert a message into a DynamoDB table</span> action, which allows you to write all, or part of, an MQTT message to a DynamoDB table. Once selected, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Configure action</span> to proceed.</li>
<li>This will take you to the <span class="packt_screen">Configure action</span> page where you can either select an existing DynamoDB table, or alternatively create one as well. For this use case, we will be relying on the <em>UUID and state</em> code that we last executed on our sample device. In order to split and write the message data to their individual columns, ensure that the DynamoDB table that you create matches the following settings:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Partition key</span>: <kbd>uuid</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Sort key</span>: <kbd>state</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Read capacity units</span>: <kbd>5</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Write capacity units</span>: <kbd>5</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="290" width="854" src="Images/df1c12e8-f5ad-410b-91b4-80c00849599f.png"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Once the table is created, select it from the <span class="packt_screen">Table name</span> drop-down list. Next, fill in the corresponding expressions in the <span class="packt_screen">Hash key value</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Range key value</span> fields, as depicted in the following screenshot. These expressions will write the message values into their corresponding DynamoDB table columns:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="248" width="634" src="Images/3593bb60-4ad4-4e7d-b7b0-bc1ca8994b65.png"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Ensure that you also create and assign an IAM Role that will grant write AWS IoT access to the DynamoDB table. With the table and IAM Role assigned, click on <span class="packt_screen">Add action</span> to complete configuring the action. You can correspondingly use the same process to add multiple actions to a single IoT rule. For example, write the device messages to a DynamoDB table as well as to an SQS queue, and so on. With the rule ready, click on <span class="packt_screen">Create rule</span> to complete the process.</li>
<li>Now, to test the rule. Run the <kbd>uuid-state</kbd> code that we ran in the earlier section. Ensure that the topic names in both the code as well as in the IoT rule match, otherwise the code will simply not write anything to the DynamoDB table:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># node test4.js</strong></pre>
<p>With the code executing, check the DynamoDB table for the data. You should see a similar output as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/62549949-1b1c-4591-96cc-b19768e3c2e7.png" width="850" height="296"/></div>
<p>With this, we come to the end of AWS IoT Core. Make sure you clean up and delete the DynamoDB table once the testing completes, to avoid any unnecessary costs. In the next section, we will be exploring yet another powerful AWS IoT service called AWS Greengrass.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Introducing AWS Greengrass</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AWS Greengrass is a form of edge computing service that extends the cloud's functionality to your IoT devices by allowing data collection and analysis closer to its point of origin. This is accomplished by executing AWS Lambda functions locally on the IoT device itself, while still leveraging the cloud for management and analytics purposes.</p>
<p>How does this help a business? Well to start with, using AWS Greengrass you are now able to respond to locally generated events in near real time! With Greengrass, you can program your IoT devices to locally process and filter data and only transmit the important chunks back to AWS for analysis. This also has a direct impact on the costs as well as the amount of data transmitted back to the cloud.</p>
<p>Here's a brief look at a few of the necessary components that go into the workings of AWS Greengrass:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greengrass Core</strong> (<strong>GGC</strong>) <strong>software</strong>: The Greengrass Core software is a packaged module that consists of a runtime to allow executions of Lambda functions, locally. It also contains an internal message broker and a deployment agent that periodically notifies the AWS Greengrass service about the device's configuration, state, available updates, and so on. The software also ensures that the connection between the device and the IoT service is secure with the help of keys and certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Greengrass groups</strong>: A Greengrass group is a collection of Greengrass Core settings and definitions that are used to manage one or more Greengrass-backed IoT devices. The groups internally comprise a few other components, namely:
<ul>
<li><strong>Greengrass group definition:</strong> A collection of information about your Greengrass group</li>
<li><strong>Device definition:</strong> A collection of IoT devices that are a part of a Greengrass group</li>
<li><strong>Greengrass group settings:</strong> Contains connection as well as configuration information along with the necessary IAM Roles required for interacting with other AWS services</li>
<li><strong>Greengrass Core:</strong> The IoT device itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lambda functions:</strong> A list of Lambda functions that can be deployed to the Greengrass Core.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> A collection of a message source, a message target and an MQTT topic to transmit the messages. The source or targets can be either the IoT service, a Lambda function or even the IoT device itself.</li>
<li><strong>Greengrass Core SDK:</strong> Greengrass also provides an SDK which you can use to write and run Lambda functions on Greengrass Core devices. The SDK currently supports Java 8, Python 2.7, and Node.js 6.10.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this key information in mind, let's go ahead and deploy our very own Greengrass Core on an IoT device.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Connecting a device to Greengrass Core</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The steps required to connect an IoT device with AWS Greengrass are very similar to those we performed during the setup of the AWS IoT Core. In this section, we are going to extend our dummy IoT device (Ubuntu Server on a virtual machine) with Greengrass using the AWS Management Console:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get started, from the AWS IoT console, select the <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass</span> option from the navigation pane.</li>
<li>Setting up Greengrass involves a three-step process starting with creating and configuring a <strong>Greengrass group</strong>, followed by adding a <strong>Greengrass Core</strong> to the group and finally, by adding the IoT device to the group. To get going, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Get Started</span> option under the <span class="packt_screen">Define a Greengrass Group</span> tile.</li>
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Set up your Greengrass Group</span> page, select the <span class="packt_screen">Use easy creation</span> option. This process will automatically provision a Core in the registry, use default settings to generate a new group, and provide your core with a new certificate and a key pair.</li>
<li>Type in a suitable group <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> for the Greengrass group and click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to proceed.</li>
<li>You can optionally choose to apply a type to this group by selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Thing Type</span> from the drop-down box, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case, we already have a <span class="packt_screen">Thing Type</span> defined from our previous exercises so we are going to use this. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to continue:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/5be984cf-247c-42d3-b4e8-cc49b3baf917.png" width="957" height="371"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Since we are using the <em>easy creation</em> method, AWS runs a scripted action that basically performs the following set of tasks for us:
<ul>
<li>Create a new Greengrass group in the cloud</li>
<li>Provision a new core in the IoT registry and add to the group</li>
<li>Generate a public and private key set for your core</li>
<li>Generate a new security certificate for the core using the keys</li>
<li>Attach a default security policy to the certificate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Group and Core</span> to proceed with the scripted install.</li>
<li>Finally, on the <span class="packt_screen">Connect your Core device</span> page, download the core-specific certificates and config file as a TAR resource by selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Download these resources as a tar.gz</span> option. You will also need to download an appropriate version of the Greengrass Core software to run on your IoT device. Since we are performing all of these activities on a Ubuntu-based virtual machine, select the <span class="packt_screen">x86_64_Ubuntu</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass Core software</span> drop-down list and download it. Once done, click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> to exit the setup.</li>
</ol>
<p>With both the Greengrass Core software and the necessary Greengrass certificates downloaded, we now have to transfer them to our IoT device using any SCP tool. Once transferred, run the following set of commands to set up and start the Greengrass Core:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>First up, untar the Greengrass Core software using the following command.</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># sudo tar -xzvf greengrass-&lt;PLATFORM-VERSION&gt;.tar.gz -C /</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, run the following command to untar and place the security files and certificates in the <kbd>greengrass</kbd> directory:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># sudo tar -xzvf &lt;UID&gt;-setup.tar.gz -C /greengrass</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once the contents of both the TAR files are extracted, run the following command to download the Root CA certificate from Symantec:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># cd /greengrass/certs/<br/># sudo wget -O root.ca.pem http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Here is the final folder structure for your reference:</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Once completed, run the following set of commands to create a dedicated user and group for Greengrass Core software:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># sudo adduser --system ggc_user 
# sudo addgroup --system ggc_group</strong> </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Next, update the host operating system and install a <kbd>sqlite3</kbd> package on it using the following commands:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># sudo apt-get update 
# sudo apt-get install sqlite3</strong> </pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>With all the pieces of the puzzle in place, we are now ready to finally start the Greengrass Core service on our IoT device. Type in the following command as shown:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># cd /greengrass/ggc/packages/1.3.0/ 
# sudo ./greengrassd start</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">You should get the following output on your Terminal, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="484" width="780" src="Images/d290971e-91cf-459e-a792-ff1cf65e2ae5.png"/></div>
<div style="padding-left: 60px" class="packt_infobox">In case of errors in connecting, you can also check the Greengrass runtime log file at the following location:<br/>
<br/>
<kbd>/greengrass/ggc/var/log/system/runtime.log.</kbd></div>
<p>Simple, isn't it! With two out of three steps completed, the final step left in completing the Greengrass connectivity is adding a device to the Greengrass group that we have created:</p>
<ol>
<li>To do so, from the AWS IoT console, select the <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span> option provided under the <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass</span> section from the navigation pane. You should see your newly created <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass group</span> present here. Select it.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Devices</span> and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add your first Device</span> option to continue.</li>
<li>Here in the <span class="packt_screen">Add a Device</span> page, you can opt to either <span class="packt_screen">Create a new Device</span> or optionally <span class="packt_screen">Use an existing IoT Thing as an Device</span>. Since we already have the IoT device registered from our earlier IoT setup, select the <span class="packt_screen">Select an IoT Thing</span> option to proceed.</li>
<li>Select the name of the added IoT device and click on <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> to complete the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it! You have successfully installed and connected your IoT device with AWS Greengrass! In the next section, we will test this deployment by running a simple Lambda function on it.</p>

<p>With the Greengrass Core software up and running on your IoT device, we can now go ahead and run a simple Lambda function on it! For this particular section, we will be leveraging an AWS Lambda blueprint that prints a simple Hello World message:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get started, first we will need to create our Lambda function. From the AWS Management Console, filter out the <span class="packt_screen">Lambda</span> service using the <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> option or alternatively, select this URL: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home">https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div style="padding-left: 60px" class="packt_infobox"><span>Ensure that the Lambda function is launched from the same region as that of the AWS Greengrass. In this case, we are using the US-East-1 (N. Virginia) region.</span></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the AWS Lambda console landing page, select the <span class="packt_screen">Create function</span> option to get started.</li>
<li>Since we are going to be leveraging an existing function blueprint for this use case, select the <span class="packt_screen">Blueprints</span> option provided on the <span class="packt_screen">Create function</span> page.</li>
<li>Use the filter to find a blueprint with the name <kbd>greengrass-hello-world</kbd>. There are two templates present to date that match this name, one function is based on Python while the other is based on Node.js. For this particular section, select the <kbd>greengrass-hello-world</kbd> Python function and click on <span class="packt_screen">Configure</span> to proceed.</li>
<li>Fill out the required details for the new function, such as a <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> followed by a valid <span class="packt_screen">Role</span>. For this section, go ahead and select the <span class="packt_screen">Create new role from template</span> option. Provide a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Role name</span> and finally, from the <span class="packt_screen">Policy templates</span> drop-down list, select the <span class="packt_screen">AWS IoT Button Permissions</span> role.</li>
<li>Once completed, click on <span class="packt_screen">Create function</span> to complete the function's creation process. But before you move on to associating this function with your AWS Greengrass, you will also need to create a new <em>version</em> out of this function. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Publish new version</span> option from the <span class="packt_screen">Actions</span> tab.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Provide a suitable <span class="packt_screen">Version description</span> text and click on <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> once done. Your function is now ready for AWS Greengrass.</li>
<li>Now, head back to the AWS IoT dashboard and select the newly deployed Greengrass group from the <span class="packt_screen">Groups</span> option present on the navigation pane.</li>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass group</span> page, select the <span class="packt_screen">Lambdas</span> option from the navigation pane followed by the <span class="packt_screen">Add Lambda</span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="329" width="821" src="Images/05554d66-7f2d-49a3-9b1b-4fa5b0c3bdb7.png"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Add a Lambda to your Greengrass group</span>, you can choose to either <span class="packt_screen">Create a new Lambda function</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Use an existing Lambda function</span> as well. Since we have already created our function, select the <span class="packt_screen">Use existing function</span> option.</li>
<li>In the next page, select your <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass Lambda function</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> to proceed. Finally, select the version of the deployed function and click on <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> once done.</li>
<li>To finish things, we will need to create a new subscription between the Lambda function (source) and the AWS IoT service (destination). Select the <span class="packt_screen">Subscriptions</span> option from the same <span class="packt_screen">Greengrass group</span> page, as shown. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add Subscription</span> to proceed:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="321" width="805" src="Images/3a52542d-c655-419f-afcc-f22c9ec0c5f1.png"/></div>
<ol start="13">
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">Select your source and target</span> page, select the newly deployed Lambda function as the source, followed by the IoT cloud as the target. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> once done. You can provide an <span class="packt_screen">Optional topic filter</span> as well, to filter messages published on the messaging queue. In this case, we have provided a simple <kbd>hello/world</kbd> as the filter for this scenario. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span> once done to complete the subscription configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all the pieces in place, it's now time to deploy our Lambda function over to the Greengrass Core. To do so, select the <span class="packt_screen">Deployments</span> option and from the <span class="packt_screen">Actions</span> drop-down list, select the <span class="packt_screen">Deploy</span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>The deployment takes a few seconds to complete. Once done, verify the status of the deployment by viewing the <span class="packt_screen">Status</span> column. The <span class="packt_screen">Status</span> should show <span class="packt_screen">Successfully completed</span>.</p>
<p>With the function now deployed, test the setup by using the MQTT client provided by AWS IoT, as done before. Remember to enter the same <kbd>hello/world</kbd> topic name in the subscription topic field and click on <span class="packt_screen">Publish to topic</span> once done. If all goes well, you should receive a custom Hello World message from the Greengrass Core as depicted in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>This was just a high level view of what you can achieve with Greengrass and Lambda. You can leverage Lambda for performing all kinds of preprocessing on data on your IoT device itself, thus saving a tremendous amount of time, as well as costs.</p>
<p>With this, we come to the end of this section. In the next section, we will be looking at a few simple ways of effectively monitoring your IoT devices.</p>

<p>AWS offers a variety of methods for monitoring both your IoT devices, as well as the IoT service and its calls. To get things started, let's first look at the simple device monitoring functionality provided by the AWS IoT dashboard itself. On the AWS IoT console page, select the <span class="packt_screen">Monitor</span> option. Here, you can view a variety of graphs and data, such as the <em>number of successful connections</em> made to the AWS IoT service over the past hour, day, or week. You can even check the number of <em>messages</em> that were transmitted using either the MQTT or the HTTP protocol, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>You can also use the <span class="packt_screen">Monitor</span> page to view the number of <em>messages published</em>, <em>rules executed</em>, and <em>shadow updates</em> performed.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you also have an option to enable logging for your AWS IoT service. To do so, select the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> option from the navigation pane of the AWS IoT console. By default, logging of AWS IoT is <em>disabled</em>, however you can easily switch it on by selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> option provided under the <span class="packt_screen">Logs</span> section. As messages from your IoT devices pass through the message broker and the rules engine, you can use the AWS IoT logs to process events and in turn, troubleshoot issues, both at the device as well as at the service's end.</p>
<p>You can choose between <span class="packt_screen">Debug (most verbose)</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Info</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Warning</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Errors (least verbose)</span> levels of verbosity, depending on your logging requirements.</p>

<p>Well, like all good journeys, this book too has come to its end! I just wanted to take this time to say that it has really been a wonderful journey and experience writing this book! Although the book may seem a lot to read and grasp, trust me, this is all just a drop in the ocean! AWS continuously strives to evolve its services by adding more and more features to it, so much so, that today you have ready-to-use services for almost anything, including game development, AI, customer engagement, business productivity, just to name a few!</p>
<p>To quickly summarize all that we have learned so far: we started our journey with some interesting hands-on with the EC2 Systems Manager, shortly followed by two of my favorite services, the Elastic Beanstalk and the Elastic File System. We also covered a lot on security in the form of AWS WAF, AWS Shield, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config! Towards the end, we started exploring a few developer-based services in the form of AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodePipeline, to name a few. Finally, we ended the last few chapters on a high note by looking at the IoT and Analytics services in Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, AWS Data Pipeline and last, but not the least, AWS IoT!</p>
<p>Till next time, cheers!</p>
