- en: The first chapter of this book will introduce the first objective, which is
    how to manage Azure subscriptions and resources. In this chapter, we are going
    to focus on assigning permissions for administrators so that they can manage your
    Azure subscriptions and resource groups. You will learn how to configure policies
    for your Azure subscriptions and resources in order to stay compliant with your
    organizational standards and SLAs. We are also going to set tagging on resource
    groups, and you'll learn how to configure cost center quotas and resource locks.
    To finish this chapter, we will cover how to move resources across different resource
    groups after creation, and how to completely remove resource groups from your
    Azure subscription.

    way, like an IT and finance department, or group them in a geographical way, like
    North America and Europe, for instance. You can add a department owner here, which

    the subscriptions, create the different resources, and assign other users to the
    subscription. Subscriptions always have a trust relationship with an Azure Active

    Database, a virtual network in Azure, and more, grouped inside the same resource
    group. They can then be managed and deleted as a single entity.

    Window` and the value to `Saturday 9 AM`. After applying these tags, you can easily
