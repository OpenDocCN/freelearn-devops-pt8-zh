These functional areas of the business can all be managed in Salesforce CRM, and in this chapter we will look at the Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Collaboration Cloud features provided by Salesforce.</p><p>Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM administration in the functional areas of Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Chatter, which are all covered in this chapter.</p><p>We will now look at each of the following core Salesforce CRM functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Marketing administration</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sales automation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customer service and support automation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Enterprise social networking and collaboration with Salesforce Chatter</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Functional overview of Salesforce CRM"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec97"/>Functional overview of Salesforce CRM</h1></div></div></div><p>The Salesforce CRM functions are related to each other and, as mentioned previously, have cross-over areas, which can be represented as shown in the following diagram:</p><p>

</p><div class="section" title="Marketing administration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec212"/>Marketing administration</h2></div></div></div><p>Marketing administration is available in Salesforce CRM under the application suite known as the <span class="strong"><strong>Marketing Cloud</strong></span>.</p><p>The core functionality enables organizations to manage marketing campaigns from initiation to lead development in conjunction with the sales team. The features in the marketing suite can help to measure the effectiveness of each campaign by analyzing the leads and opportunities generated as a result of specific marketing activities.</p></div><div class="section" title="Salesforce automation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec213"/>Salesforce automation</h2></div></div></div><p>Salesforce automation is the core feature set within Salesforce CRM and is used to manage the sales process and activities. It enables salespeople to automate manual and repetitive tasks and provides them with information related to existing and prospective customers. In Salesforce CRM, Salesforce automation is known as the <span class="strong"><strong>Sales Cloud</strong></span> and helps salespeople manage sales activities, leads and contact records, opportunities, quotes, and forecasts.</p></div><div class="section" title="Customer service and support automation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec214"/>Customer service and support automation</h2></div></div></div><p>Customer service and support automation within Salesforce CRM is known as the <span class="strong"><strong>Service Cloud</strong></span> and allows support teams to automate and manage the requests for service and support by existing customers. Using the Service Cloud features, organizations can handle customer requests such as the return of faulty goods or repairs, complaints, or provide advice about products and services.</p><p>Associated with the functional areas described previously are features and mechanisms to help users and customers collaborate and share information known as enterprise social networking.</p></div><div class="section" title="Enterprise social networking with Salesforce Chatter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec215"/>Enterprise social networking with Salesforce Chatter</h2></div></div></div><p>Enterprise social network capabilities within Salesforce CRM enable organizations to connect with people and securely share business information in real time. Social networking within an enterprise serves to connect both employees and customers and enables business collaboration. In Salesforce CRM, the enterprise social network suite is known as <span class="strong"><strong>Salesforce Chatter</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Salesforce CRM record life cycle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec216"/>Salesforce CRM record life cycle</h2></div></div></div><p>The capabilities of Salesforce CRM enables the processing of campaigns through to customer acquisition and beyond, as shown in the following diagram:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_002.jpg" alt="Salesforce CRM record life cycle"/></div><p>
</p><p>At the start of the process, it is the responsibility of the marketing team to develop suitable campaigns in order to generate leads. Campaign management is carried out using Marketing Administration tools and has links to the lead, as well as any opportunities that have been influenced by the campaign.</p><p>When validated, leads are converted to accounts, contacts, and opportunities. This can be the responsibility of either the marketing or sales teams and requires a suitable sales process to have been agreed upon. In Salesforce CRM, an account is the company or organization and a contact is an individual associated with an account.</p><p>Opportunities can either be generated from lead conversion or may be entered directly by the sales team. As described earlier in this book, the structure of Salesforce requires account ownership to be established - which sees inherited ownership of the opportunity. Account ownership is usually the responsibility of the sales team.</p><p>Opportunities are worked through a sales process using sales stages, where the stage is advanced to the point where they are set as Closed Won/Closed and represent final sales. Opportunity information should be logged in the organization's financial system.</p><p>Upon acceptance of the deal by the finance team (and perhaps delivery of the goods or service), the post-customer acquisition process is then enabled, which is when the account and contact can be recognized as a customer. Here, the customer relationships concerning incidents and requests are managed by escalating cases within the customer services and support automation suite.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Marketing administration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec98"/>Marketing administration</h1></div></div></div><p>Marketing administration in Salesforce CRM provides closed-loop marketing automation from within the marketing app, which can be accessed from the <span class="strong"><strong>App Menu</strong></span> at the top-right corner of the Salesforce CRM screen.</p><p>Marketing administration enables integrated marketing functions such as campaign management, lead management, reporting and analysis, response tracking, and campaign effectiveness and it allows users from various departments to centrally access marketing activity.</p><p>By default, the marketing administration features provide some level of read-only access to all users. However, to create, edit, and delete campaigns, and carry out advanced campaign and lead management functions, users must have the Marketing User License set on their user record, shown as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_003.jpg" alt="Marketing administration"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note280"/>Note</h3><p>The Marketing User License is available as standard for organizations with Enterprise or Unlimited editions and can be applied to any active user.</p></div></div><p>The following key features are available within Salesforce CRM marketing administration:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lead management</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Campaign management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec217"/>Campaign management</h2></div></div></div><p>With targeted marketing campaigns, companies can build market awareness, generate leads, and learn from their campaign results to fine-tune offers to various customer segments.</p><p>The campaign management feature in Salesforce CRM allows your users to manage and track outbound marketing activities. These can be direct mail, roadshow, online or print advertising, e-mail, or other types of marketing initiatives.</p><p>Some CRM systems have sales and marketing features separated, requiring marketing and sales users to log on to two separate modules; however, with Salesforce CRM, a dedicated <span class="strong"><strong>Campaign tab</strong></span> is provided to enable marketing and sales users to work together within a single system.</p><p>Within the <span class="strong"><strong>Campaign tab</strong></span>, the marketing team can access sales information for their campaigns and the sales team have insight into the marketing activities that affect their accounts, contacts, and leads. Campaigns can also be organized into hierarchies for flexible analysis of related marketing initiatives.</p><p>By integrating the marketing and sales effort for campaign and lead management activities, far greater collaboration can be achieved.</p><p>Essential success criteria for campaigns can be captured and used to further develop the definition of marketing targets. This enables marketing departments to become more accountable and to better demonstrate their marketing <span class="strong"><strong>Return On Investment (ROI)</strong></span>
</p><p>The steps to consider when managing and working with campaigns in Salesforce CRM are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign planning</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign setup</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign creation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign execution</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign responses</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Campaign effectiveness</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Campaign planning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec224"/>Campaign planning</h3></div></div></div><p>Before starting to build and run campaigns, it is useful to have an overall plan of the goals and objectives of the campaign, such as the core processes and the type of campaign, such as mass marketing e-mails, hosting a conference, sending direct mail, and so on.</p><p>The targets for the campaign also need to be identified and whether they are existing customers, existing leads, or new leads should be defined. With existing leads, you can use lead scoring and lead status to facilitate customer segmentation. For example, a series of archived status definitions could be used, such as No Interest, Future Interest, Nurture, and so on.</p><p>Consider how you need to analyze and report on campaigns.</p><p>It is worth considering this at an early stage so you can look to create custom campaign fields. You can customize campaigns so that you can improve the targeting and customer segmentation and help to compare and analyze which types of campaigns are the most effective for your sales and marketing teams.</p><p>Your marketing team may also want to target new leads through the use of third-party lists. These third-party lists of suspects, prospects, or leads can be flagged in Salesforce with a specific indicator. By flagging with a different record type, or assigning to a different queue, these lead records can be kept apart from existing prospects so that any pre-qualification or de-duplicating can be done before they are available for use in campaigns.</p></div><div class="section" title="Campaign setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec225"/>Campaign setup</h3></div></div></div><p>When setting up campaign management, you should identify who should have access to your campaigns.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note281"/>Note</h3><p>To create, edit, and delete campaigns and configure advanced campaign setup, users must have the <span class="strong"><strong>Marketing User license</strong></span> checked on their user record.</p></div></div><p>By default, all users have read access to campaigns, but to create, edit, or delete campaigns, users must have the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> permission on their profile, shown as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_004.jpg" alt="Campaign setup"/></div><p>
</p><p>When starting new types of campaigns, your marketing and sales teams should collaborate to agree on the customer information that is to be captured. Here, you can use the standard fields for both the Campaign and Campaign Member objects or create new custom fields as appropriate.</p><div class="section" title="Standard campaign fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec40"/>Standard campaign fields</h4></div></div></div><p>The following key standard fields are available on the Campaign object:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

What is particularly important is the de-duplication of any new leads against existing records in your Salesforce database so that you can determine which are existing customers or leads.</p><p>Salesforce does not recommend mass importing rented or purchased lists of prospects into Salesforce, as these lists are usually controlled by the list vendor and may have restriction or limited use policies. Here, you should simply make use of the list of names as your target list and only after the prospect has responded to your campaign should you import the lead record.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Campaign execution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec227"/>Campaign execution</h3></div></div></div><p>Although campaign execution activities occur outside the Salesforce CRM application during the execution of either an offline or an online campaign, there are some features of the campaign activity that can aid using the export facilities within Salesforce.</p><p>Users can use Salesforce to generate lists of accounts and individuals for mailing houses. or e-mailing specialist partners to send out mass marketing e-mails used in both online and offline events (such as trade shows, advertisements, direct mail, and so on).</p><p>There are various options available for integrating Salesforce with other solutions, including provision for mass e-mailing. Integration solutions are covered later in this book, where sources include the <code class="literal">AppExchange</code> directory (a Salesforce.com sponsored market place for accredited products and services).</p><p>Salesforce can be used to deliver mass e-mails, but the application is not intended for large volume mass e-mail marketing, and there are limits to the quantity of e-mails that can be sent.</p><p>For each Salesforce application, a total of 1,000 e-mails can be sent per day to external e-mail addresses. Using the Enterprise Edition, the maximum number of external addresses (unique or non-unique) you can include in a mass e-mail is 500, and for Unlimited and Performance Edition the limit is 1000.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note283"/>Note</h3><p>The mass e-mail limits do not take unique addresses into account. For example, if you have <code class="literal">john.smith@widgetsXYZ.com</code> in your mass e-mail 500 times, that counts as 500 against any limit.</p></div></div><p>You can build an integrated web form to automatically capture individuals as leads in Salesforce.

</p><p>As an example, the <span class="strong"><strong>Campaign ROI Analysis Report</strong></span> shows performance metrics and gives you a figure for the return on investment for the campaign, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

<span class="strong"><strong>Note</strong></span>: all opportunities that are linked to the Campaign must be set to Closed Won and the Campaign must be set as the Primary campaign for them to be included in the Total Value of Won Opportunities amount.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Customizable Campaign Influence overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec230"/>Customizable Campaign Influence overview</h3></div></div></div><p>Salesforce has improved upon the campaign influence mechanism described previously and provides the <span class="strong"><strong>Customizable Campaign Influence</strong></span> functionality.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Customizable Campaign Influence</strong></span> allows you to choose how the revenue from an opportunity is attributed to multiple campaigns that are associated with it.</p><p>At the time of writing, the features that are common to Campaign Influence and Customizable Campaign Influence are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Auto-association with an opportunity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Can use a Salesforce Default Model which attributes 100% of revenue to the primary campaign on the opportunity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applies Campaign Influence on the opportunitiy as per the specified Model</li></ul></div><p>At the time of writing, the features that are only available in Customizable Campaign Influence are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ability to create custom Campaign Attribution Models</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Allows Flexible Influence Attribution</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Enables Campaign Attribution Models to be locked</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Allows Campaign Influence to be applied on an opportunity for the given Campaign Attribution Model</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Produces Campaign Results on Campaigns for the given Campaign Attribution Model</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Allows API access</li></ul></div><p>With <span class="strong"><strong>Customizable Campaign Influence</strong></span> you can configure multiple ways to track how an opportunity has benefited and been influenced by one or more campaigns.

Examples of custom attribution models are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Attributing 100% of the revenue to the initial campaign to have been associated with the opportunity.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Attributing 100% of the revenue to the latest campaign to have been associated with the opportunity.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Evenly distributing the revenue across all campaigns that have been associated with the opportunity.</li></ul></div><p>With <span class="strong"><strong>Customizable Campaign Influence</strong></span> you can prevent users from manually creating or updating campaign influence records which are associated to opportunities by locking the Attribution Model.

The status and quality of prospect data can cause obstacles when trying to automate the processing through the sales process. Prospect data often comes from various sources which, if not carefully controlled, can make them difficult to accurately process.</p><p>Without a central system and agreed approach, there can be conflict between the marketing team, who are often unable to trace what is happening to the prospects after distributing them to sales, and the sales team, who are unable to verify the quality of the data. Salesforce CRM helps bridge any gap between sales and marketing, and by using lead management mechanisms it offers a way to improve the management and automation of the flow from potential customers to a closed sales deal.</p><p>Leads are prospects or potential opportunities and are accessed in Salesforce CRM from the <span class="strong"><strong>Leads</strong></span> tab. They are sources of potential deals that usually need more qualification, and they may be visitors to your website who requested more information, respondents to marketing campaigns, trade show visitors, and so on.

During lead conversion, new records are created for these objects, where the account record name field will contain the <span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span> field value from the lead, and the contact record name field will be populated from the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> field within the lead record.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note293"/>Note</h3><p>Any existing account or contact records are automatically checked before the lead conversion to avoid record duplication.</p></div></div><p>Opportunities that are created upon lead conversion contain default values for the required fields, where the <span class="strong"><strong>Close Date</strong></span> defaults to the last day of the current quarter and <span class="strong"><strong>Sales Stage</strong></span> is set to the first value in the Stage picklist.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note294"/>Note</h3><p>During the lead conversion, there is no opportunity amount value set on the resulting opportunity.</p></div></div><p>To convert a lead, select the lead that is to be converted either by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead</strong></span> tab and selecting from the list view or by searching and then clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Convert</strong></span> on the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Detail</strong></span> page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_030.jpg" alt="Lead conversion"/></div><p>
</p><p>The lead conversion screen will be displayed where you can check the owner of the new records. Here, you can choose to send the record owner an automated notification e-mail. You can also set the status of the converted lead and also specify that a new task is created for the record owner to act as a follow-up task, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_031.jpg" alt="Lead conversion"/></div><p>
</p><p>Before creating any new account or contact records, the Salesforce CRM application attempts to match an existing account, contact names, and the name of the lead. Where there is a match you will have the option of selecting the existing records, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_032.jpg" alt="Lead conversion"/></div><p>
</p><p>Clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Convert</strong></span> button completes the lead conversion process and results in the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The company name from the lead becomes the account name</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The lead name from the lead becomes the contact name</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The opportunity and contact are associated with the account</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Any campaigns related to the lead are associated with the opportunity<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note295"/>Note</h3><p>Converted leads can no longer be viewed in the <span class="strong"><strong>Leads</strong></span> tab, and the only way to view the record is to create a lead report. When customizing your report, enter a filter option of <span class="strong"><strong>Converted equals True</strong></span> to view converted leads.</p></div></div></li></ul></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Lead conversion field mappings</strong></span></p><p>There are standard field mappings between the lead and account, contact, and opportunity records that are provided by Salesforce for the lead conversion process; however, you can extend these. To extend the mappings, follow the path <span class="strong"><strong>Setup | Customize | Leads | Fields.</strong></span> Now navigate to the <span class="strong"><strong>Lead Custom Fields &amp; Relationships</strong></span> section at the bottom of the page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_033.jpg" alt="Lead conversion"/></div><p>
</p><p>Extending the field mappings may become necessary whenever you add required custom fields on either the account, contact, or opportunity records, which are to be populated from the lead records. This is done as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_08_034.jpg" alt="Lead conversion"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note296"/>Note</h3><p>
</p><p>It is important to ensure the field mapping is in place whenever you have certain mandatory fields or rules for your account, contacts, or opportunities. This ensures that the quality of data is preserved. You can enable the setting <span class="strong"><strong>Require Validation for Converted Leads</strong></span> as shown in the screenshot shown in the section Lead settings to enforce the validation logic during the lead conversion process.  By disabling the setting <span class="strong"><strong>Require Validation for Converted Leads</strong></span> the validation logic for required custom fields and workflow or validation rules is not enforced during the lead conversion process.</p><p>

Enabling and automating these phases within CRM systems helps to improve the quality and also minimizes the time that sales representatives spend on each phase.</p><p>Salesforce automation in Salesforce.com is performed within the <span class="strong"><strong>Sales App,</strong></span> which can be accessed from the <span class="strong"><strong>App</strong></span> Menu at the top-right corner of the Salesforce CRM screen.</p><p>At the core of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sales App</strong></span> in Salesforce CRM are the account, contact, and opportunity management functions for tracking and recording each stage in the sales process for new and existing customers.</p><p>Accounts can be sorted by standard views or customized views, and users can add new accounts and edit existing accounts. Associated contacts and activities are also listed in the same page of the account where users can manipulate other operations, such as viewing, adding, and editing as necessary.

However, Salesforce provides another variety of account called a Person Account, which allows organizations with a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) business model to manage the relationships with individuals. The <code class="literal">Business account</code> and <code class="literal">Person Account</code> records offer very similar features and fields; however, Person accounts do not have certain fields or features, such as a <span class="strong"><strong>Reports To field</strong></span>, a <span class="strong"><strong>Parent Account field</strong></span>, or the Account Hierarchy feature.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note297"/>Note</h3><p>Person accounts are not enabled by default in the Salesforce CRM application and are only available by request to Salesforce customer support.</p></div></div><p>Business account information consists of company name, type, company website, industry, annual revenue, billing and shipping addresses, account record owner, date of creation and modification, and so on.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip298"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Naming convention for accounts:</strong></span></p><p>Having consistent account names is essential for ensuring clean and accurate account data. It can be useful to adopt an appropriate account naming policy to be used by all users in Salesforce. One way to achieve this is to ensure that accounts are named using their full legal name wherever possible.</p></div></div><p>As described earlier in this book, accounts are also the primary mechanism used in the organization of records.</p><p>They are used within the record sharing and ownership hierarchy and are the parent object for standard objects, such as contacts, opportunities, and so on. When changing ownership of account records, you have the option to re-assign these child records, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

For support, the contacts could be any of the users of the product or service that your organization provides.</p><p>Salesforce CRM provides the facility for users to store, view, sort, filter, delete, edit, and find contact information which may or may not be associated with accounts. Each contact is recorded with details such as title, contact details (address, cell phone, work phone, fax, and e-mail address), date of creation and modification, and contact record owner.</p></div><div class="section" title="Activity management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec221"/>Activity management</h2></div></div></div><p>Activities in Salesforce are made up of tasks and events.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec103"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we looked at the functional areas within Salesforce CRM, where we described the process from campaign to customer and beyond. We saw how leads in Salesforce CRM can be converted to generate the accounts, contacts, and opportunity records, which would then be processed through the sales cycle to form customer records, and we also saw how these customers can be supported by the customer service and support teams using the case management features.</p><p>Within the functional areas, we touched on when business teams concerned with marketing, sales, and customer service have to agree on roles and responsibilities for aspects of the business processes. We also looked at Salesforce <span class="strong"><strong>Chatter</strong></span>, a collaboration application that helps in this respect by connecting people and sharing business information.</p><p>Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce's Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Chatter<span class="strong"><strong>.</strong></span>
</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at the ways in which the Salesforce CRM platform can be extended further through the use of customization technologies, such as Visualforce, where you can leverage further benefits for your organization and enhance the system without the need for expensive IT development resources.</p></div></body></html>
