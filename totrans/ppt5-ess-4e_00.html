<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="sugarfield">Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate all your IT configurations, giving you control over what you do with each Puppet agent in a network, and when and how you do it. In this age of digital delivery and ubiquitous internet presence, it's becoming increasingly important to implement scalable and portable solutions, not only in terms of software but also the system that runs it.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span class="sugarfield">This book aims to impart knowledge required to tap into not only the basics of Puppet, but also its core. The very basic ideas and principles of Puppet-based designs are explored and explained in this book. A sophisticated tool is presented to enable efficient and productive use.</span></p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The file resource type will return <kbd>mtime</kbd> and <kbd>ctime</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>node 'agent' {<br/>     $packages = [ 'apache2', 'libapache2-mod-php5', 'libapache2-mod-passenger', ]<br/>     package { $packages:<br/>       ensure =&gt; 'installed',<br/>       before =&gt; Service['apache2'],<br/>      }<br/>     service { 'apache2':<br/>       ensure =&gt; 'running',<br/>       enable =&gt; true,<br/>     }<br/>   }</pre>
<p class="NormalPACKT">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>service { 'puppet': enable =&gt; false }<br/>cron { 'puppet-agent-run':<br/>  <strong>user    =&gt; 'root',</strong><br/>  command =&gt;<br/>    'puppet agent --no-daemonize --onetime --<br/>     logdest=syslog',<br/>   minute =&gt; fqdn_rand(60),<br/>   hour   =&gt; absent,<br/>} </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>puppet:///modules/ntp/ntp.conf<br/></strong><strong>puppet:///modules/my_app/opt/scripts/find_my_app.sh</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "If you are looking for a module that will enhance your agents through additional resource types and providers, look for the <span class="packt_screen">Types</span> tab on the module details page. "</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
