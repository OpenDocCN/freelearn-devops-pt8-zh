<p>In the previous chapter, we covered the last <span>part of the <em>Deploying and Managing Virtual Machines</em> objective by covering how to manage Azure VMs and VM backups</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>This chapter introduces the new objective, <em>Deploying and Managing Virtual Networks</em><em>.</em><span> </span>In this chapter, we are going to focus on virtual networking in Azure and how you can implement and manage this. You will learn about the basics of Azure virtual networking, including private and public IP addresses, and you will learn how to configure subnets, <strong>Virtual Networks</strong> (<strong>VNets</strong>), and public and private IP addresses. To finish this chapter, we are going to configure VNet peering.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure VNet</li>
<li>IP addresses</li>
<li><span>Configuring</span> subnets and VNet<span>s</span></li>
<li>Configuring private and public IP addresses</li>

<p>An Azure VNet is a virtual representation of a traditional network, hosted in the cloud. It is totally software-based, whereas traditional networks use cables, routers, and more. VNets provide a secure and isolated environment, and they connect Azure resources with each other. By default, the different resources are not reachable from outside of the VNet. However, you can connect multiple VNets to each other or connect a VNet to your on-premises network as well. All the Azure resources that are connected to each other inside the same VNet must reside in the same region and subscription.</p>
<p>When you create a VNet, one subnet is automatically created for you. You can create multiple subnets inside the same VNet (with a maximum of 1,000 subnets per VNet). Connecting multiple VNets together is called VNet peering. A maximum of 10 peerings are allowed per Azure subscription.</p>
<p>The smallest subnet that can be used in Azure is the <kbd>/29</kbd> subnet, which consists of eight addresses, and the largest is <kbd>/8</kbd>, which consists of 16 million addresses.</p>

<p>A VNet in Azure can have private and public IP addresses. Private IP addresses are only accessible from within the VNet, and public IP addresses can be accessed from the internet as well. You can access private IP addresses from a VPN gateway or an ExpressRoute connection. Both private and public IP addresses can be static or dynamic, but when you create a new VNet, the IP address is static by default. You can change the IP address to <em>static</em> from the Azure portal, PowerShell, and CLI. The following are the two states of IP address:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong>: Dynamic IP addresses are assigned by Azure automatically and are selected from the configured subnet's address range from the virtual network where the Azure resource resides. The IP address is assigned to the Azure resource upon creation or start. The IP address will then be released when the resource is stopped and deallocated (when you stop the VM from the Azure portal, the VM is deallocated automatically), and added back to the pool of available addresses inside the subnet by Azure.</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong>: Static IP addresses (private and public) are preassigned and will remain the same until you delete the assignment. You can select a static private IP address manually. They can only be assigned to non-internet-facing connections, such as an internal load balancer. You can assign a private static IP address to a connection of your on-premises network or to an ExpressRoute circuit. Public static IP addresses are created by Azure automatically, and they can be assigned to internet-facing connections, such as an external load balancer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public IP addresses can be used for internal communication between Azure services and external communication over the internet. You can use IPv4 and IPv6 for public IP addresses, but support for IPv6 is limited. At the time of writing, you can only assign IPv6 addresses to external load balancers.</p>
<p>When the Azure resource is started or created, Azure will assign the public IP address to the network interface of the VNet. When an outbound connection is initiated, Azure will map the private IP address to the public IP addresses, that is, <strong>source network address translation</strong> (<strong>SNAT</strong>).</p>
<p>Azure assigns the public IP address to the network interface when the Azure resource is started or created. When an outbound connection is initiated, Azure will map the private IP address to the public IP address (SNAT). Return traffic to the resource is allowed as well. Public IP addresses are typically used for VMs, internet-facing load balancers, VPN gateways, and application gateways. There is a maximum of 60 dynamic public IP addresses and 20 static public IP addresses per subscription. The first five static IP address are free to use.</p>

<p>Private IP addresses support IPv4 and IPv6 as well, but support for IPv6 is limited. They can only be assigned dynamically, and IPv6 addresses cannot communicate with each other inside a VNet. The only way to use IPv6 addresses is by assigning them to an internet-facing load balancer, where the frontend IP address is an IPv4 address and the backend is an IPV6 address. Private IP addresses are typically used for VMs, internal load balancers, and application gateways. Because of the fact that a VPN is always internet-facing, it cannot have a private IP address. There is a maximum amount of 4,096 private IP addresses per VNet. However, you can create multiple VNets (with a maximum amount of 50 VNets per subscription).</p>

<div class="packt_infobox">These limits are based on the default limits from the following page: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#networking-limits">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#networking-limits</a>.

<p>Now that we have some background information about the various networking aspects in Azure, we can configure a virtual network with a subnet.</p>

<p>In this demonstration, we are going to create and configure a virtual network and a subnet from the Azure portal. We already created both of these in earlier demonstrations, <span>for instance, </span>when we created VMs. We are now going to cover this topic in more detail.</p>
<p>In the next demonstration, we are going to configure a virtual network and a subnet using PowerShell. Therefore, we have to take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to log in to the Azure account as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Connect-AzAccount</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If necessary, select the right subscription as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId "********-****-****-****-***********"</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a resource group for the VNet as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>New-AzResourceGroup -Name PacktVNetResourceGroup -Location EastUS</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Next, we can create the VNet as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `</strong><br/><strong>  -ResourceGroupName PacktVNetResourceGroup `</strong><br/><strong>  -Location EastUS `</strong><br/><strong>  -Name PacktVirtualNetwork `</strong><br/><strong>  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16</strong></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Then, create the subnet as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$subnetConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `</strong><br/><strong>  -Name default `</strong><br/><strong>  -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24 `</strong><br/><strong>  -VirtualNetwork $virtualNetwork</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<ol start="6">
<li>Last, associate the subnet to the virtual network as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork</strong></pre>
<p>We have now created a VNet and a subnet from PowerShell. We will use this for later demonstrations in this chapter. In the next section, we are going to configure a private and a public IP address in PowerShell, and associate them to this VNet.</p>

<p>In this demonstration, we are going to configure a private and a public IP address. When we created the VNet, a private IP address was already created for us automatically by Azure. However, we are going to create another in this demonstration and associate it, together with the public IP address, to a <strong>network interface card</strong> (<strong>NIC</strong>). To configure a private and public IP address from PowerShell, you have to take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="mce-root"><span>In the same PowerShell window, add the following code to retrieve the VNet and subnet configuration:</span></li>
</ol>
<pre style="color: black;padding-left: 60px"><strong>$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name PacktVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName PacktVNetResourceGroup</strong><br/><strong>$subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name default -VirtualNetwork $vnet</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, create a private and public IP address and assign them to the configuration as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$publicIP = New-AzPublicIpAddress `</strong><br/><strong>    -Name PacktPublicIP `</strong><br/><strong>    -ResourceGroupName PacktVNetResourceGroup `</strong><br/><strong>    -AllocationMethod Dynamic `</strong><br/><strong>    -Location EastUS</strong><br/><br/><strong>$IpConfig = New-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig `</strong><br/><strong>  -Name PacktPrivateIP `</strong><br/><strong>  -Subnet $subnet `</strong><br/><strong>  -PrivateIpAddress 10.0.0.4 `</strong><br/><strong>  -PublicIPAddress $publicIP `</strong><br/><strong>  -Primary</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>Then, create a network interface and assign the configuration to it as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$NIC = New-AzNetworkInterface `</strong><br/><strong>  -Name PacktNIC `</strong><br/><strong>  -ResourceGroupName PacktVNetResourceGroup `</strong><br/><strong>  -Location EastUS `</strong><br/><strong>  -IpConfiguration $IpConfig</strong></pre>
<p>We now have configured an NIC, a public, and a private IP address, and associated them with the VNet that we created in the earlier demonstration.</p>

<p>When you create subnets, Azure creates system routes that enable all resources in a subnet to communicate with each other. Every subnet has the following default system route table that contains the following minimum routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local VNet</strong>:<span> </span>This is a route for resources that reside in the VNet. For these routes, there is no next hop address. If the destination IP address contains the local<span> </span>VNet<span> </span>prefix, traffic is routed there. </li>
<li><strong>On-premises</strong>: <span>This is a route for defined on-premises address spaces. For this route, the next hop address will be the VNet gateway. If the destination IP address contains the on-premises address prefix, traffic is routed there. </span></li>
<li><strong>Internet</strong>:<span> </span>This route is for all traffic that goes over the public internet and the internet gateway is always the next hop address. If the <span>destination IP address doesn't contain the VNet or on-premises prefixes, traffic is routed to the internet using <strong>network address translation</strong> (<strong>NAT</strong>).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You can override the system routes by creating <strong>user-defined routes</strong> (<strong>UDRs</strong>). This way, you can force traffic to follow a particular route. </span>For instance, you have a network that consists of two subnets and you want to add a VM that is used as a <strong>demilitarized zone</strong> (<strong>DMZ</strong>) and has a firewall installed on it. You want traffic only to go through the firewall and not between the two subnets. To create UDRs and enable IP forwarding, you have to create a routing table in Azure. When this table is created and there are custom routes in there, Azure prefers the custom routes over the default system routes.</p>

<p>VNet<span> peering is a mechanism that seamlessly connects two VNets in the same region through the Azure backbone infrastructure. Once peered, the VNets appear as one for connectivity purposes, just like routing traffic between VMs that are created in the same VNet. The VMs that reside in the peered VNets communicate with each other using private IP addresses.</span></p>
<p><span>Azure supports the following two different types of peering:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>VNet peering</strong></span>: T<span>his is used for connecting VNets in the same Azure region.</span></li>
<li><strong>Global VNet peering</strong>: This is used for connecting VNets across different Azure regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The network traffic between peered VNets is private. The traffic is kept on the Microsoft backbone network completely, so there is no need for using any additional gateways, or route traffic over the public internet. There is also no encryption required in the communication between the peered VNets. It uses a low-latency, high-bandwidth connection between the resources in the different virtual networks.</span></p>
<p><span>You can use VNet peering for connecting VNets that are created through the resource manager and the classic deployment model together, and it offers the ability to transfer data across Azure regions and Azure subscriptions.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>VNet peering is different from using an Azure VPN gateway to connect two VNets together. When you use an Azure VPN Gateway to connect two VNets to each other, it is called a <strong>VNet-to-VNet connection</strong>.

<li>There are a couple of other settings that you can set here as well. The first one is <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Allow</strong> <strong>forwarded traffic from PacktVirtualNetwork to PacktVNetPeering</strong></span>: this means that you allow traffic from outside the peered VNet. The second one is <strong><span class="packt_screen">Configure gateway transit settings</span></strong>: this means that the peered network uses the gateway of this VNet to connect to resources outside the peered VNet, for instance, an on-premises environment. The last one is <span class="packt_screen">Configure Remote Gateway Settings:</span> for this setting, you have to enable the previous one as well, but by enabling this one, you are using the other VNet gateway to connect resources outside the VNet.</li>
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen"><strong>OK</strong>, </span>and the peering is created.</li>

<p>We have now configured <span>VNet peering</span> from the Azure portal. This concludes this chapter.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">There are various ways to verify the network connectivity. In <a href="af30dbe4-17d7-4358-8e6b-e3eae2b34d4a.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Monitoring and Troubleshooting Virtual Networking</em>, this is covered in more detail.</div>

<p><span>In this chapter, we covered the first part of the <em>Deploying and Managing Virtual Networks</em><em> </em>objective by covering virtual networking in Azure. We have configured VNets and created private and public IP addresses. We also configured VNet peering from the Azure portal.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue with this objective, by covering how to integrate an on-premise network with an Azure VNet.</p>
