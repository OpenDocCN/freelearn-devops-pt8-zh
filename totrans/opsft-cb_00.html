At the time of writing this, OpenShift officially supports the Java, Ruby, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Perl programming language runtimes, along with the MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases. It also offers Jenkins CI, RockMongo, Mongo Monitoring Service agent, phpMyAdmin, and a lot of other features. OpenShift, being extensible in nature, allows developers to extend it by adding support for runtimes, databases, and other services, which OpenShift currently does not support. Developers can work with OpenShift using command-line tools, IDE integrations, or a web console. OpenShift manages application deployment using a popular version control system named Git. The OpenShift PaaS has made cloud-enabled web application development an easy process. It is straightforward to deploy existing or new applications on OpenShift. Many developers around the world are making use of the OpenShift capabilities to develop and deploy faster.</p><p class="calibre6">Getting started with OpenShift is easy, but as is the case with many of the tools we use to develop web applications, it can take time to appreciate all the capabilities of OpenShift. The OpenShift platform and its client tools are full of features you might never have known to wish for. Once you know about them, they can make you more productive and help in writing scalable web applications.</p><p class="calibre6">
<span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">OpenShift Cookbook</em></span> presents over 100 recipes written in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. It will walk you through a number of recipes, showcasing the OpenShift features and demonstrating how to deploy a particular technology or framework on it. You can quickly learn and start deploying applications on OpenShift immediately. The cookbook also covers topics such as horizontal scaling and application logging and monitoring. The recipes covered address the common, everyday problems required to effectively run applications on OpenShift. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the PaaS and cloud computing concepts. The book does not need to be read from cover to cover, which enables the reader to choose chapters and recipes that are of interest. <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">OpenShift Cookbook</em></span> is an easy read and is packed with practical recipes and helpful screenshots.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre11" id="calibre_pb_1"/>
