<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">It involves designing systems to contain and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">manage failures in the smallest scope possible, minimizing the impact on overall operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">This approach requires a comprehensive understanding of potential failure modes and implementing targeted mitigation strategies to either prevent these failures or recover gracefully from them.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">HA, discussed in detail in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Chapter 2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">, is closely related to reliability but with an emphasis on ensuring that services remain accessible at all times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">HA strategies involve creating redundant systems and components to eliminate single points of failure, thereby allowing for seamless failover in case of an outage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">The goal is to maintain service continuity even in the face of hardware failures, network disruptions, or software bugs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">By integrating reliability and HA into the system design, organizations can ensure that their applications are robust against failures and capable of maintaining consistent service levels.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">In this discussion are the standard design principles that help you to strengthen your system’s reliability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">You will find that all reliability design principles are closely related and complement each other.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-261"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Making systems self-healing by applying automation</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Integrating self-healing capabilities and automation into your system’s design enhances its reliability </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">by allowing it to predict and recover from failures autonomously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">A self-healing system proactively detects and rectifies failures across various system layers—be it hardware, network, or software—minimizing the impact on end users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">This approach </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">requires identifying critical </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">key performance indicators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">KPIs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">) relevant to your application and business operations, such as request handling capacity per second or web page load times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Infrastructure-level KPIs might include thresholds for CPU and memory utilization, ensuring they do not exceed predefined limits.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">To achieve a self-healing architecture, implement a robust monitoring system that tracks these KPIs and alerts you as they approach critical thresholds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">This system should be backed by automation strategies that can, for example, spin up additional servers to manage increased load when CPU utilization nears its maximum allowable percentage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">This level of proactive monitoring and automated response not only prevents potential failures but also supports the system in maintaining optimal performance levels without manual intervention.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Moreover, embracing automation across your application’s life cycle—from deployment and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">configuration to scaling the infrastructure—fosters a more agile and resilient environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">It enables your team to deploy new features rapidly, experiment more freely, and ensure consistent system performance regardless of fluctuating workloads. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Automating the scaling of resources based on scheduled demands or unexpected spikes in traffic ensures that the application remains responsive and available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">By leveraging automation for deploying independent jobs and aggregating their outcomes, you can achieve not only higher reliability and efficiency but also enhance the system’s ability to self-recover from incidents, making your infrastructure truly resilient and self-sustaining.</span></p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-262"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Quality assurance</span></h3>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Frequently, you need to apply the same configuration that you have on your development </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">environment to </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">quality assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">QA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">) environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">There may be multiple QA environments for each testing stage, which includes functional testing, </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">user acceptance testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">UAT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">), and stress testing environments. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Often, a QA tester </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">discovers a defect caused by wrongly configured resources, which could introduce a further delay in the test schedule. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Most importantly, you cannot afford a configuration error in production servers, which can cause widespread outages, so better to test them in advance.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">To reproduce precisely the same configuration as your development environment to your QA environment, you may need to document step-by-step configuration instructions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Repeating the same steps to configure each environment manually can be error-prone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">There is always a chance of human error, such as a typo, for example, in a database name. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.4">The solution to this challenge is to automate these steps by creating a script. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.5">The automation script itself can be the documentation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">As long as the script is correct, it is more reliable than manual configuration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">It is undoubtedly reproducible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Detecting unhealthy resources and launching replacement resources </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">can be automated, and you can notify the IT operations team when resources are changed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Automation is a fundamental design principle that needs to be applied everywhere in your system.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-263"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Creating a distributed system</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Monolithic applications have low reliability regarding system uptime, as a tiny issue in a particular module can bring down the entire system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Dividing your application into multiple small services reduces the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">impact area</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">One part of the application shouldn’t impact </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1118"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">the whole system, and the application can continue to serve critical functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">For example, in an e-commerce website, an issue with the payment service should not affect the customer’s ability to place orders, as payment can be processed later.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">At the service level, scale your application horizontally to increase system availability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">Design a system to use multiple smaller components working together rather than a single monolithic system to reduce the impact area. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">In a distributed design, requests are handled by different system components, and the failure of one component doesn’t impact the functioning of other parts of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">For example, on an e-commerce website, the failure of warehouse management components will not impact the customer placing the order.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">However, the communication mechanism can be complicated in a distributed system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">This complexity arises from the need to ensure reliable data exchange across various networked computers, each possibly running different operating systems and located in different geographical areas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">Challenges include dealing with network latency, handling message delivery guarantees, synchronizing data across nodes to ensure consistency, and implementing fault tolerance to withstand partial system failures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.4">Additionally, the development and maintenance of a communication protocol that efficiently supports the diverse requirements of a distributed architecture add to the intricacy.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">The circuit breaker pattern can help here to handle system dependencies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">As you learned regarding the circuit breaker pattern in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Solution Architecture Design Patterns</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">, the basic idea is simple. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">You wrap a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for failures and takes automated action to mitigate them.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-264"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Monitoring and adding capacity</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Resource saturation is the most common reason for application failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Often, you will encounter the issue where your applications start rejecting requests due to CPU, memory, or hard disk overload.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">In a traditional </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">on-premises </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">environment, you must calculate server capacity based on the assumption in advance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Online traffic is very unpredictable and fluctuates heavily, driven by global trends. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">Usually, procuring hardware can take anywhere between 3 to 6 months, and it’s tough to guess capacity in advance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">Ordering excess hardware will incur an extra cost as a resource is sitting idle, and a lack of resources will cause the loss of business due to application unreliability.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">You need an environment where you don’t need to guess capacity, and your application can scale on demand.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">A public cloud </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">provider such as </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Amazon Web Services</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">AWS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">) provides </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">infrastructure as a service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">IaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">), facilitating the on-demand availability </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">of resources.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">In the cloud, you can monitor system supply and demand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">You can automate the addition or removal of resources as needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">It allows you to maintain the level of resources that will satisfy demand without over-provisioning or under-provisioning.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-265"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Performing recovery validation</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">When it comes to infrastructure validation, most of the time, organizations focus on validating a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">happy path where everything is working. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Instead, you should validate how your system fails and how well your recovery procedures work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">Validate your application, assuming everything fails all the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">Don’t just expect that your recovery and failover strategies will work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.5">Make sure to test them regularly so you’re not surprised if something goes wrong.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">A simulation-based validation helps you to uncover any potential risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">You can automate a possible scenario that could cause your system to fail and prepare an incident response accordingly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Your validation should improve application reliability so that nothing will fail in production.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Organizations can tailor their warm standby environment to handle a specific percentage of their production traffic, such as 20%, 30%, or 50%, depending on their recovery objectives and budget considerations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">This flexibility allows for a customized DR solution that aligns with business needs and risk tolerance levels.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">Furthermore, the warm standby environment isn’t just limited to DR scenarios; it can also serve dual purposes by providing a platform for non-production uses such as testing, staging, or development work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">This dual use of the warm standby environment maximizes the value of the DR investment by utilizing the infrastructure for additional purposes beyond mere standby readiness, thereby optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Start small and build as needed</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">: Make sure you first bring up the critical workloads with the most business impact and build upon this to bring up less critical loads.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">Apply the data backup life cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">: Take backups of everything, whether it is your file server, machine image, or databases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">Keeping lots of active backups could increase costs, however, so make sure to apply a life cycle policy to archive and delete data as per your business needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">For example, you can choose to keep a 90-day active backup and, after that period, store it in low-cost archive storage such as a tape drive or Amazon Glacier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.4">After 1 or 2 years, you may want to set a life cycle policy to delete the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.5">Compliance with standards such as PCI-DSS may require you to store data for seven years, and in that case, you must opt for archival data storage to reduce costs.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">Check your software licenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">: Managing software licenses can be a daunting task, especially in the current microservice architecture environment, where you have several services running independently on their virtual machines and databases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.2">Software licenses could be associated with several installations, a number of CPUs, and several users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.3">It becomes tricky when you go for scaling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.4">It’s important to monitor and check these; you need to have enough licenses to support your scaling needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.5">Also ensure you don’t buy excessive licenses, which you may not utilize and will cost you more money. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.6">Overall, make sure to manage your license inventory, like your infrastructure or software.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Plan your scaling</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">: For horizontal scaling, add more instances with software installed, and in vertical scaling, add more CPU or memory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">You need to understand your software licensing agreement and ensure you have enough licenses to fulfill system scaling. </span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">Test your solutions often</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">: DR sites are created for rare DR events and are often overlooked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">You need to ensure your DR solution is working as expected to achieve high reliability in case of an incident. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.3">Compromising a defined SLA can violate contractual obligations and cause a loss of money and customer trust.</span></li>
