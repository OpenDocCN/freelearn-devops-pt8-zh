<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is a practical introduction to creating applications using containers. Readers will learn what containers are and why they are a new application deployment standard. We will start the journey with key concepts about containers, their features and usage, and how they will help us secure and speed up an application’s life cycle. You will also learn how to create secure container images for your applications and how to share and run them in different development stages <span class="No-Break">and production.</span></p>
<p>The book is divided into different parts to help you use the software container technology. First, you will learn how to use a host environment to build and run your applications using multiple components, and then you will learn how to run them when distributed in complex <span class="No-Break">container orchestrators.</span></p>
<p>This book focuses on the Kubernetes container orchestrator because of its unique features and popularity. You will learn how to use different Kubernetes resources to securely accomplish different application architecture models. You will also find different software options in this book that will help you create and test your applications on your desktop, using fully functional Kubernetes-packaged platforms. We will teach you how to use these Kubernetes desktop environments to prepare your applications, using the best security practices to deliver them on any Kubernetes platform. We will cover important topics such as data management (configurations, sensitive data, and application data), different mechanisms to publish applications, and application observability (monitoring, logging, <span class="No-Break">and traceability).</span></p>
<p>Finally, we will show you how to automate the building, testing, and delivery of your applications, creating continuous integration and continuous delivery workflows that run within <span class="No-Break">Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>In this book, we will use different open source tools to create, run, and share software containers. The book presents different options for the labs, and you can choose the environment in which you feel more comfortable. To follow the labs in this book, you will need <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>A common laptop or desktop computer with a modern CPU (Intel Core i5 or i7, or an equivalent AMD CPU) and 16 GB of RAM is recommended. You would probably be able to run the labs with lower resources, but your experience may be impacted.</li>
<li>A Microsoft Windows or Linux operating system. Although Linux will be referred to in this book, you can use either.</li>
<li>You are expected to have some user-level knowledge of Linux/Windows.</li>
<li>Some experience in coding in common programming languages, such as Go, JavaScript, Java, or .NET Core, will be useful, although the examples are not complicated and will be easy to follow.</li>
