    information using the user profile mechanism. We have seen how the appropriate
    object level permissions, such as create, read, update, and delete have to be
    set on the user's profile to allow the user corresponding permissions to the records
    of that object type.

    security that can be configured by system administrators and these can be applied
    at different levels in the platform. We will now look at the multiple levels that
    allow you to apply data access and security control to the information in your
    Salesforce org.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first and highest level of data access and security is at the organization
    level. This allows for controlled access to Salesforce by authorized users where
    you can configure rules such as password policies and login access rules. These
    settings are covered in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Managing Users and Controlling
    System Access"), *Managing Users and Controlling System Access.*

- en: Objects and fields
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second and third level of data access and security is at object and field
    level respectively. Data access and security at object level provides the most
    basic category of controlling which data users have access to. Objects can have
    permissions applied to allow or prevent users from creating, reading, updating,
    or deleting data records for that particular object. The third level is at field
    level. Here, you can use field-level security to control access to specific fields.
    You can restrict access to a particular field and prevent a user from accessing
    it even if they have full access to the associated object. These features are
    covered in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Configuring Objects and Apps"), *Configuring
    Objects and Apps*.

    record level. The mechanisms for record level access allow for control at the
    most precise level where you can allow particular users to view object and fields,
    but then restrict the actual records associated with that object. For example,
    record-level access can be set to allow a user to view and edit their own records,
    without exposing these records to other users in the system. This level of access
    is made possible in Salesforce CRM with the in-built data access security model.

    has any administrative permissions, such as **View All Data** or **Modify All
    Data**.
