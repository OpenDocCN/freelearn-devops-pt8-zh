- en: In the previous chapter, we built VM Clouds and IaaS services for our WAP-based
    cloud. In this chapter, we will move ahead toward completing a ready-to-use cloud
    solution by learning about methods of assigning these services to tenants. We
    will cover planning and the implementation of cloud plans to which tenants need
    to be subscribed to use services. We will also cover add-ons, the tenant's subscriptions,
    and the tenant's user account management.

- en: Windows Azure Pack plan, also known as hosting plan, is a mechanism of assigning
    cloud service offerings to tenants as per their deal or contract agreement considerations,
    such as a variety of services, quota, the amount of resources available, the quality
    of service, and so on. The cloud provider creates and configures the plan as per
    the deal or cloud offering strategy; tenants subscribe to the plan to get access
    to configured cloud service offerings. A plan usually contains a collection of
    services to be made available along with defined restrictions or limits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A single plan can be subscribed by multiple tenants having the same requirements.
    A plan may consist of multiple resource provider services, such as **VM Clouds**
    (**IaaS**), websites and **Service Bus** (**PaaS**), **Databases** (**DBaaS**),
    or other custom offerings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tenants cannot access cloud services without subscribing to at least one plan.
    They may subscribe to multiple plans as per requirements. When a tenant user subscribes
    to WAP plans, a new subscription is generated and is dedicated for that particular
    tenant. This subscription is used to identify and access tenants' resources across
    the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally, plans are also mapped with the pricing of services. Multiple plans
    with different pricing schemes and services can be created. There are multiple
    billing adaptors or solutions available that can be used along with WAP plans
    for offering cloud services as per the pricing defined by cloud providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Add-ons are used to provide additional capabilities and limits over a plan,
    such as additional quotas for using any additional number of virtual machines
    or compute resources. Add-ons are linked to plans and can only be subscribed if
    the tenant has an active subscription to the plan.

    multiple SCVMM stamps or clouds, there has to be separate plans for these. This

- en: A subscription is an object that defines a tenant's access to a plan and is
    used to identify the tenant's resources and access across the cloud. A subscription
    is created when tenants sign up for any plan or add-on.
  prefs: []

- en: A subscription is one-to-one mapping between tenant user and plan access. One
    subscription can be attached to only one plan, whereas single tenants can have
    multiple subscriptions. Windows Azure Pack provides self-services access to tenants
    for creating and managing subscriptions as defined by cloud administrators. In
    this topic, you will learn about subscription management from a cloud administrator's
    point of view; the tenant's point of view will be covered in the next chapter.
