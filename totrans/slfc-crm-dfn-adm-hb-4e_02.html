We were introduced to the concept of a user being assigned a profile that could be set to control certain permissions. The user profile login permissions we looked at were restrictions on login hours and IP addresses, which allow you to control when, and from where, users log in to the Salesforce application.</p><p>In this chapter, we will look at how users can be managed in more detail and understand how some of the key profile settings are used within the Salesforce CRM application.</p><p>We will start to look into the ways in which a user's profile controls both access to objects and also governs what features are available to that user.</p><p>Along with profiles, this chapter also begins to look at the concept of record sharing and provides a high-level look at sharing features within Salesforce. It also describes how these features control access to records for users.</p><p>Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM administration in the area of user setup, which is covered in this chapter.</p><p>We will now look at the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to record ownership, profiles, and sharing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Managing users in Salesforce</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Controlling system access</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Logging in as another user</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Salesforce.com Health Check</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Questions to test your knowledge</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Introduction to record ownership, profiles, and sharing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13"/>Introduction to record ownership, profiles, and sharing</h1></div></div></div><p>Before looking at the features available to manage users, we start with a brief introduction to the concepts of record owner, profiles, and sharing in Salesforce CRM.</p><div class="section" title="Record owner"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec36"/>Record owner</h2></div></div></div><p>The terminology record owner is reflected throughout Salesforce and for each and every data record there can be one, and only one, record owner.</p><p>Only users that are active in Salesforce can have records assigned to them.</p><p>When a user is marked inactive in Salesforce CRM, he/she no longer has access to the application. However, any records that this inactive user owns remain in the application and continue to show the inactive user as the record owner.</p><p>The record owner setting generally determines if access to that record is available to other users within the organization, and is enabled using either profile or sharing settings.</p></div><div class="section" title="Profiles and sharing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec37"/>Profiles and sharing</h2></div></div></div><p>Profiles, sharing, and the optional role hierarchy setting work together and should be considered as a whole when setting up record ownership and data access for users. An overview of the relationship between users, profiles, and the sharing settings can be pictured as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_02_001.jpg" alt="Profiles and sharing"/></div><p>
</p><p>All users in Salesforce must be assigned a profile. The profile is a control mechanism used to determine which functions the user can perform, which types of data they can access, and which operations they can carry out on that data.</p><p>All users are associated with sharing mechanisms in Salesforce, which determine the actual records the user can access. Controlling the level of record access can be achieved using options ranging from default sharing, which is set at the organization level, to role hierarchy and beyond using advanced sharing mechanisms. A user does not have to be assigned to a role in Salesforce.</p><p>The sharing rules are briefly outlined as follows and covered in far more detail later in this book.</p><div class="section" title="Profiles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec67"/>Profiles</h3></div></div></div><p>Some of the key controls of the profile are to identify the type of license specified for the user, any login hours or IP address restrictions, and control access to objects. If the appropriate object-level permission is not set on the user's profile, the user will be unable to access the records of that object type in the application.</p><p>Profiles never override your organization's sharing model or role hierarchy. For example, a profile may be set to allow a user access to create, edit, and delete leads. However, a user with this profile cannot edit or delete other user's leads if your organization's lead sharing model is read-only.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Configuring Objects and Apps">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuring Objects and Apps</em></span>, we will look in detail at the features that the profile controls, which includes tabs, object-level security, field-level security, Apex/Visualforce page accessibility, console layout, application selections, and administrative and general user permissions.</p><p>There are two types of profile in Salesforce: standard and custom, with each standard or custom profile belonging to exactly one user license type.</p><p>Standard profiles and custom profiles are similar in nature, the difference being that for standard profiles, the following types of settings cannot be applied: administrative permissions, general user permissions, and object-level permissions, plus, notably, the <span class="strong"><strong>password never expires</strong></span> setting, which means you are not required to change your password after a certain amount of time (this is a part of the password policies, which are described later). Hence, you must either create a custom profile or use a permission set, (described later in this chapter), if you want to enable any of those features.</p><p>There are a number of standard profile types such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Contract manager</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Marketing user</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Solution manager</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Standard user</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">System administrator</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Contract manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec5"/>Contract manager</h4></div></div></div><p>The contract manager profile is generally used to manage contracts and override forecasts.</p></div><div class="section" title="Marketing user"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec6"/>Marketing user</h4></div></div></div><p>The marketing user profile is generally used to manage campaigns, import leads, and manage public documents. Users with this profile have access to the same functions as standard user profiles.</p></div><div class="section" title="Solution manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec7"/>Solution manager</h4></div></div></div><p>The solution manager profile is generally used to publish and review solutions. Users with this profile have access to the same functions as standard user profiles.</p></div><div class="section" title="Standard user"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec8"/>Standard user</h4></div></div></div><p>The standard user profile is used to create and edit the main types of records. This profile also allows users to run reports and view the organization's setup. Notably, this profile can view, but not manage, campaigns. This profile can create, but cannot review solutions.</p></div><div class="section" title="System administrator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec9"/>System administrator</h4></div></div></div><p>The system administrator profile is used to configure and customize the application. Users with this profile has access to all functionality that does not require any additional licenses. For example, system administrators cannot manage campaigns unless they also have a marketing user license.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note62"/>Note</h3><p>Standard profiles have their uses, but it is wise to limit the cloning of them to create custom profiles as it has been known for Salesforce to change the settings for standard profiles when a new release is rolled out, which can result in an undesired outcome for any user assigned with that profile.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Sharing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec68"/>Sharing</h3></div></div></div><p>Sharing settings control the default access for each object across the organization. Sharing rules per object can grant access beyond the default sharing settings; they cannot restrict access. The default sharing settings are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Controlled by Parent</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Private</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Public Read Only</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Public Read/Write</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Public Read/Write/Transfer</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Public Full Access</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Grant Access Using Hierarchies</strong></span></li></ul></div><p>When the <span class="strong"><strong>Grant Access Using Hierarchies</strong></span> setting is enabled, the role of the record owner determines visibility throughout the organization. Users in higher roles in the hierarchy will have full access (view/edit/delete) to all records owned by those at a lower level in the role hierarchy.</p><p>If Grant Access Using Hierarchies is not enabled, all roles are treated equally regardless of the hierarchy.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note63"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Grant Access Using Hierarchies</strong></span> is only applicable for custom objects since they cannot be disabled for standard objects.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec10"/>Roles</h4></div></div></div><p>Roles are the principal elements in sharing rules. Users can be grouped into roles based upon their need of access to data, according to how they fit into the role hierarchy. Creating a role for every user's job title is not required.</p><p>Roles are accessed throughout the application and are particularly important for reporting. For instance, if you have two departments, Operations and Sales, you can run comparative reports on both roles.</p><p>Roles generally report to another role and are used to maintain the role hierarchy. It is a one-to-many hierarchical relationship with the hierarchy, allowing managers to see the data of the users that report to them. Users at any given role level are always able to view, edit, and report on all data owned by, or shared with, users below them in the hierarchy.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note64"/>Note</h3><p>You can create up to 500 roles for your organization.</p></div></div><p>Role hierarchies do not need to specifically match your organization chart. Instead, each role in the hierarchy should represent a level of data access required by users.</p></div><div class="section" title="Permission Sets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec11"/>Permission Sets</h4></div></div></div><p>Permission sets allow you to further control access to the system for the users in your organization. They can be considered as a method to fine-tune the permissions for selected individuals and enable access in a similar way to the setting up of profiles.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note65"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span> allow you to grant further access but not restrict or deny access.</p></div></div><p>While an individual user can have only one profile, you can assign multiple permissions and permission sets to users. For example, you can create a permission called <span class="strong"><strong>Convert Leads</strong></span> that provides the facility for converting and transferring the leads and assign it to a user who has a profile, which does not provide lead conversion. You can create a permission called <span class="strong"><strong>Edit Contacts</strong></span> and assign it to a user who has a profile that does not provide contact editing. You can also group these permissions into a permission set to create specific profile-like permissions without actually having to create or clone complete profiles, which are often unnecessary.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note66"/>Note</h3><p>You can create up to 1,000 permission sets for your organization.</p></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span> are an ideal mechanism to apply system access for your users without affecting all other users that have the same profile and without having to create one-off profiles, which sometimes lead to an increase in the amount of maintenance.</p><p>A common use for <span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span> is to grant additional permissions in addition to the settings listed in a profile to individuals without changing their profile. For example, to provide more rights than their profile currently allows.</p></div><div class="section" title="Creating Permission Sets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl4sec12"/>Creating Permission Sets</h4></div></div></div><p>To create (or clone) <span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span>, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Users</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note67"/>Note</h3><p>When you clone an existing permission set, the new permission set has the same user license and enabled permissions as the permission set it is cloned from.</p></div></div><p>To create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Permission Sets</strong></span> click on <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_02_002.jpg" alt="Creating Permission Sets"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now enter a <span class="strong"><strong>Label</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>API Name</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Description</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note68"/>Note</h3><p>If you plan to assign the permission set to users that all have the same type of user license, a best practice is to associate that user license with the permission set. However, if you plan to assign the permission set to users that currently have different licenses (or may have different licenses in the future), it is probably best to create an organization-wide permission set.</p></div></div><p>To continue creating the permission set (as outlined previously), either select a <span class="strong"><strong>User License</strong></span> or select the option <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span> (to create an organization-wide permission set). Now finally, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note69"/>Note</h3><p>When you clone an existing permission set, the new permission set has the same user license and enabled permissions as the permission set it is cloned from.</p></div></div><p>

</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip74"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Do not overwrite active or inactive user records with new user data:</strong></span></p><p>Salesforce does not recommend overwriting inactive user records with new user data. Doing so prevents you from tracking the history of past users and the records associated with them.</p></div></div><p>There are also situations where you may feel it appropriate to recycle an active user record, but it is better to deactivate users when they are no longer using Salesforce and create a new record for each new user.</p><p>A typical real-world example of recycling a user record, and one to avoid, is sometimes encountered when a sales team is organized into sales territories.</p><p>The sales team user records in Salesforce are stamped with a territory indicator and any account records that are located in their particular territory are assigned to the user record (set as the record owner). In this way, the user record simply acts as a container for the territory.</p><p>Managing user records in this way results in both audit and maintenance issues. For example, if Tina Fox changes sales territory, her personal information (username, password, e-mail address, phone number, and so on) all has to be transferred to a new user record requiring Tina to reactivate a new password, re-enter both her personal details, and all her personal preferences in the Salesforce application.</p><p>The issue worsens if the user record (or territory) that Tina is reassigning to, is held by, say, Timothy Little as he would also need to reset his personal details.</p><p>This approach leads to a technically complex method of territory reassignment and a very disappointing user experience for your sales team. Fortunately, Salesforce provides features such as criteria-based sharing rules, sales teams, and territory management to better manage the organization of sales territories.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Adding multiple users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec39"/>Adding multiple users</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have several users to add, you can add more than one at a time.</p><p>To add multiple users, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Users</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Users</strong></span>. Now click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Multiple Users</strong></span> button.</p><p>This is a two-step process: First you select the user license type and then you are presented with multiple sections to add the new user's details. As you can see in the following screenshot, this can be a quick method for creating users, since not all required fields have to be entered in this process:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_02_009.jpg" alt="Adding multiple users"/></div><p>
</p><p>If, however, after the initial saving of multiple user records, you attempt to edit a user record, via the user edit screen, you will be prompted to fill up all mandatory fields.</p></div><div class="section" title="Delegation of user management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec40"/>Delegation of user management</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have an organization with a large number of users or a complex role hierarchy, you can delegate aspects of user administration to users who are not assigned to the system administrator profile.</p><p>This allows you to focus on tasks other than managing users for every department or structure that your company has within Salesforce. This provides further benefits for global organizations that encounter time zone and cultural differences as it allows a user based in that region with local knowledge to create the users, which saves time and results in a better user experience.</p><p>For example, you may want to allow the manager of the Asia Pacific Operations team to create and edit users in the Asia Pacific Operations Team Leader role and all subordinate roles.</p><p>There are currently two options for providing this delegated user management access:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a profile with the Manage Users permission</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use delegated administration</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating a profile with the Manage Users permission"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec41"/>Creating a profile with the Manage Users permission</h2></div></div></div><p>This option is not recommended and should be very carefully considered as it allows a much greater range of system administration functions to be carried out by the user.</p><p>In addition to creating and managing users, the <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Users</strong></span> permission also allows the user to perform the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Expire all passwords</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Clone, edit, or delete profiles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Edit or delete sharing settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Edit user login hours</li></ul></div><p>By providing users with the<span class="strong"><strong> Manage Users</strong></span> permission, as you can see, there are many other permissions that are switched on, which introduces security risks.</p></div><div class="section" title="Using delegated administration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec42"/>Using delegated administration</h2></div></div></div><p>Delegated administration is a more secure method for providing delegated user management access as it allows you to assign limited administrative privileges to the selected non-administrator users in your organization.</p><p>Delegated administrators can perform the following tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating and editing users, and resetting passwords for users in specified roles and all subordinate roles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Assigning users to specified profiles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Logging in as another user</li></ul></div><p>To create delegated groups, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Security Controls</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Delegated Administration</strong></span>.

<div class="section" title="Session timeout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Session timeout</h1></div></div></div><p>There are various features for setting the session timeout as per the following sections:</p><div class="section" title="Timeout value"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec57"/>Timeout value</h2></div></div></div><p>This sets the length of time after which inactive users are automatically logged out of the system.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note89"/>Note</h3><p>The options are between <span class="strong"><strong>15 minutes</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>12 hours</strong></span>.As a system administrator you need to balance the requirements for user satisfaction and enforcement of security controls, however it is recommended that you choose as short a timeout period as possible to protect sensitive information and enforce stricter security.</p></div></div><p>The value of the last active session is not updated until halfway through the timeout period. So if you have a 2-hour timeout, the system does not check for activity until 1 hour has passed. As an example, say you have a 2-hour timeout value. If you update a record after 30 minutes, the last active session value is not updated because there was no activity after 1 hour and hence you will still be logged out in a further 1 hour and 30 minutes because the last active session has not been updated.</p></div><div class="section" title="Disable session timeout warning popup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec58"/>Disable session timeout warning popup</h2></div></div></div><p>This sets whether inactive users are presented with a timeout warning message.
