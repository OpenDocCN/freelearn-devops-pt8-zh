    last chapter for it would be. We strongly believe that learning never ends! That
    being said, we came to the conclusion that a good last chapter would be related
    to some suggestions about training and the next steps you could take to keep learning
    and deepening your knowledge even further—we hope you enjoy the options we introduce
    here.

    change that these companies often forget to implement: cultural shift is the most
    challenging thing about DevOps—by far, from our perspective. If you feel that
    you and your team need a cultural refreshment, this course is for you. It follows
    a practical approach with 5-day immersive training that we recommend you take
