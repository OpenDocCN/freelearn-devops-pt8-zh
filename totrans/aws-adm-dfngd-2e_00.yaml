- en: Amazon Web Services has been the go-to cloud for customers and enterprises for
    a long time now. The cloud provider has evolved from just an Infrastructure as
    a Service provider to everything and anything as a service that helps in the development
    of applications, game development, IoT, big data analysis, customer engagement
    services, AR-VR, and much more! However, with so many services and products coming
    up each year, it tends to get difficult for beginners to know where and how exactly
    to start using these services.

    which contains a list of actions to be performed by the document, followed by
    a `mainSteps` section that specifies the action, which in this case is the `aws:configurePackage` to
    be performed by the document. In this case, the document when invoked will ask
    the user to select either `apache2`, `mysql-server`, or `php` from the dropdown
    list followed by an optional version number of the software you select."'
