- en: The AWS platform is growing at a rapid rate, and it's being increasingly adopted
    across all industries and sectors. As the saying goes, friends don't let friends
    build data centers. No matter how you look at it, the model of pay-as-you-go compute,
    network, and storage is here to stay. It's also becoming increasingly hard to
    argue against *standing on the shoulders of giants*, especially when you look
    the rate with which features and enhancements are added to the AWS platform compared
    to what you'd typically get out of other cloud providers or a so-called *private* cloud.

- en: This book is intended to kick-start your AWS journey by providing recipes, patterns,
    and best practices across the areas we are often asked to help with on our consulting
    engagements. All the recipes and recommendations contained in this book are based
    on our personal experiences and observations from our time helping customers on
    the AWS platform.

- en: CloudFormation is the AWS-native method for automating the (repeatable and reliable)
    deployment of AWS resources, and we use it extensively throughout this book. The
    recipes that follow will help you get well acquainted with CloudFormation, and
    you'll soon be on your way to customizing and building your own templates. With
    so much power at your fingertips, there's a lot of potential for finding yourself
    in a rabbit hole. This book aims to steer you in the right direction and help
    you adopt the platform in a sustainable and maintainable way.
