    for being connected in people's personal and professional lives. And how more
    and more, the users of their apps are living lives connected to the Internet,
    but rather than sitting at a desk in the office, they are in between meetings,
    on the road, in planes, in trains, in cabs, or even in the queue for lunch. As
    a result, Salesforce have developed innovative mobile solutions that help you
    and your users embrace this mobile-first world in Salesforce CRM.

    and downloadable apps. Mobile browser apps, as the name suggests, are accessed
    using a web browser that is available on a mobile device. Downloadable apps are
    accessed by first downloading the client software from, say, the Apple App Store
    or Google Play and then installing it onto the mobile device. Mobile browser apps
    and downloadable apps offer various features and benefits and, as will be covered,
    are available for various Salesforce mobile products and device combinations.

    may be used to access Salesforce CRM, however some Salesforce mobile products
    are optimized for use with certain devices. By accessing a Salesforce mobile browser
    app, your users do not require anything to be installed. Supported mobile browsers
    for Salesforce are generally available on Android, Apple, BlackBerry, and Microsoft
