This chapter describes the way login attempts to the system are controlled and the features available to help you manage your user's access to the Salesforce CRM application.</p><p>In this chapter, we will also look at establishing your company profile within Salesforce and how core information, such as the details that are provided when your company first signs up with <a class="ulink" href="http://Salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a>, can be managed. You will also be shown how to find your way around the Salesforce Setup menu, and will be introduced to the settings available for the organization-wide customization of the application's user interface along with the search facilities offered by the Salesforce CRM application.</p><p>Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM administration in the areas of organization setup and the global user interface, which are covered in this chapter.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, notes and tips are provided to offer further guidance within the given areas of functionality; and have been generated from the practical results and experience of the Salesforce CRM system administration.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Salesforce setup menu</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User login and authorization</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Company profiles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User interface</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Search overview and settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Questions to test your knowledge</li></ul></div><p>To start with, we will look at the location and the features of the Salesforce Setup menu.</p><div class="section" title="The Salesforce Setup menu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec7"/>The Salesforce Setup menu</h1></div></div></div><p>Depending upon your organization's user interface settings, you will access the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> menu from either the drop-down menu under your name or as a top-level setup link, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>Looking at the top of the Salesforce page you should see the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> link, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_01_001.jpg" alt="The Salesforce Setup menu"/></div><p>
</p><p>If you do not see the Setup link at the top of the Salesforce page then click on your name and you will then see the setup option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_01_002.jpg" alt="The Salesforce Setup menu"/></div><p>
</p><p>This setting is controlled by the <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Improved Setup User Interface</strong></span> setting, which is covered later in this chapter.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note3"/>Note</h3><p>As a system administrator, you will use the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> menu so frequently that it is recommended that you enable <span class="strong"><strong>Improved Setup User Interface</strong></span>.The <span class="strong"><strong>Improved Setup User Interface</strong></span> setting is activated by default for all new instances. Existing Salesforce instance admins should be aware that this user interface setting determines how everyone in your organization accesses the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> menu.</p></div></div><p>When describing any setup steps within this book, we will begin the navigation path from <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span>. For example, to enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Improved Setup User Interface</strong></span>, we will present the navigation path as <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Customize</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>User Interface</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Enable Improved Setup User Interface</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> menu appears on the left side of the page. Clicking the menu option text, (or the drop-down icon to the left of a menu option), expands the menu where you can then select the required menu item link; the following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Users</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Users</strong></span> setup page:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_01_003.jpg" alt="The Salesforce Setup menu"/></div><p>
</p><p>Clicking the down arrow icon to the left of the expanded menu option collapses the menu option. You can also expand or collapse all the menu options by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Expand All</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Collapse All</strong></span> links as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

As you type, any options that match your search term appear in the Setup menu. For example, to find the User Interface page, start to type <code class="literal">user interface</code> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick Find</strong></span> box as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>

</p><p>We will now look at how user's login requests are verified and authorized by the Salesforce CRM application.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="User login and authorization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec8"/>User login and authorization</h1></div></div></div><p>Organizations have several methods of accessing the Salesforce CRM application. Access can be gained from the user interface (using a web browser), the API (for example, using an integrated client application or the Apex Data Loader), a desktop client (for example, Salesforce for Outlook), or from a mobile client application.</p><p>Whenever a login attempt is made to Salesforce using any of these methods, the user's login request is authorized by the system using the following sequence of checks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Does the user's profile have any login restrictions?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Does the user's IP address appear within the organization's trusted IP address list?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Has the user been activated from this IP address before?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Does the user's web browser have a valid browser cookie from Salesforce stored?</li></ul></div><p>If the user's login is from neither a trusted IP address nor a browser with a valid Salesforce cookie, the login is denied.

This feature enables users to receive a one-time PIN delivered via SMS. This is set by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Security Controls</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Session Settings</strong></span> and then enabling <span class="strong"><strong>Enable SMS-Based Identity Confirmation</strong></span>.</p><p>Once enabled, users must verify their mobile phone number before taking advantage of this feature, which will present the following screenshot:</p><p>

Users are notified within the Salesforce, and can enter the verification code as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_01_011.jpg" alt="Email message verification code"/></div><p>
</p><p>Salesforce sends the verification code e-mail to the e-mail address associated with the user's record in Salesforce. Here, the following screenshot shows an e-mail example:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/image_01_012.jpg" alt="Email message verification code"/></div><p>
</p><p>The e-mail instructs the user to enter the verification code into the browser window, which activates the device for verified login into the Salesforce CRM platform.</p><p>The activation code within the e-mail is valid for up to 24 hours from the time the <span class="strong"><strong>E-mail me a verification code</strong></span> button was clicked. After 24 hours, the activation link will expire and the user must repeat the activation process.</p><p>Confusion can occur if your company has remote users that connect to Salesforce away from the company network, such as from home or from public Internet connections. The Remote users are likely to have dynamically assigned IP addresses set as their computer identity. Because of this, whenever they attempt to log in, Salesforce will identify it as an unknown IP address, prompt for verification, and the remote user will have to re-verify the device.</p><p>The remote user will then have to access the e-mail associated with their Salesforce user record to retrieve the activation e-mail, and it is here where confusion can occur. If the remote user has to access corporate web e-mail using a <span class="strong"><strong>Virtual Private Network</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VPN</strong></span>) connection, the clicking of the activation link may not work because the IP address that is being validated may now no longer be the same IP address used by the browser. This is because the VPN connection may likely be using a web proxy.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note8"/>Note</h3><p>It is recommended that you establish a policy to ensure that the user verifies the login while connected to the VPN, or can access non-VPN-based web mail (if this is permitted in your company) to ensure that the validated IP addresses are the same.</p></div></div><p>(This is covered in more detail in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Session settings</em></span> section in

A security token is an automatically generated key from Salesforce. For example, if a user's password is <code class="literal">pa$$word</code>, and their security token is <code class="literal">XXXXXX</code>, then the user must enter <code class="literal">pa$$wordXXXXXX</code>.</p><p>Users can obtain their security token by changing their password, or by resetting their security token via the <a class="ulink" href="http://Salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> user interface by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Your Name</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>My Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Personal</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Reset My Security Token</strong></span> and then clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Reset Security Token</strong></span> button.</p><p>When a user changes their password or resets their security token, Salesforce sends a new security token to the e-mail address associated with their Salesforce user record. The security token is valid until a user resets their security token, changes their password, or has their password reset by a system administrator.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip9"/>Tip</h3><p>Do not enter a security token within your password when accessing Salesforce from a web browser. It is recommended that you obtain your security token via the Salesforce user interface from a trusted network prior to attempting access from a new IP address. When a user's password is changed, the user's security token is automatically reset. The user will experience a blocked login until they add the security token to the end of their password or enter the new password after you have added their IP address to the organization's trusted IP range.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

If your organization follows the twelve-month structure, you can use a standard fiscal year. Standard fiscal years can start on the first day of any month, and you can specify whether the fiscal year is named for the starting or ending year. For example, if your fiscal year starts in April 2020 and ends in March 2021, your fiscal year setting can be either 2020 or 2021.</p></div><div class="section" title="Custom fiscal years"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec11"/>Custom fiscal years</h3></div></div></div><p>Fiscal year is more complicated than this, you can define these periods using custom fiscal years. For example, as part of a custom fiscal year, you can create a 13-week quarter represented by three periods of 4, 4, and 5 weeks, instead of calendar months.</p><p>If you use a fiscal year structure, such as a 4-4-5 or a 13-period structure, you can define a fiscal year by specifying a start date and an included template. If your fiscal year structure is not included in the templates, you can modify a template. For example, if you use three fiscal quarters per year (a trimester) instead of four, delete or modify the quarters and periods to meet your needs. These custom fiscal periods can be named based on your standards. For example, a fiscal period could be called <span class="strong"><strong>P12</strong></span> or December.</p><p>Fiscal years can be modified any time you need to change their definition. For example, an extra week could be added to synchronize a custom fiscal year with a standard calendar in a leap year.

If you're using Sidebar Search, an asterisk (*) is automatically appended at the end of the search string
If you're using Global Search, question marks match only one character in the middle (not the beginning or end) of your search term.
