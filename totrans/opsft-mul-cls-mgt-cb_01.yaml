    applications running in a public cloud provider is not a simple thing – cloud
    providers'' billing models are multifaceted, with hundreds of different options
    and combinations, each with a pricing factor. Finding the best cost-benefit for
    one application can take a significant amount of time. To make things even more

    no limits, when you integrate your applications with your legacy infrastructure,
    you might be creating a **harmful** dependency, which will limit their scalability.

    can we prevent dependency issues (or at least minimize them)?'

    to the business if the cloud provider decides to raise prices in the next contractual

    most mature and complete solutions built on top of Kubernetes.
