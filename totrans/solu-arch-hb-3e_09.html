<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-282"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Automating manual tasks</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Technology moves fast, and IT operations need to keep up with that, particularly where hardware </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1193"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">and software inventories are procured from multiple vendors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Enterprises are building hybrid cloud and multi-cloud systems, so you must learn how to handle both on-premises and cloud operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">Modern systems have extensive user bases, with various microservices working together and millions of devices connected in a network. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.4">There are many moving parts in an IT operation, making it difficult to run things manually.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Organizations maintain agility, and operations have to be fast to make use of the required infrastructure for new service development and deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">The operations team has a more significant responsibility to keep services up and running and recover quickly in case of an unexpected event. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Now, it is required to take a proactive approach in IT operations rather than waiting for an incident to happen and then reacting.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Your operations team can work very efficiently by applying automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.2">Manual jobs need to be automated so that the team can focus on more strategic initiatives rather than getting overworked with tactical work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.3">Automating active discovery and response for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1194"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">any security threat is most important to free up the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Spinning up a new server or starting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1195"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">and stopping services should be automated using an </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">infrastructure as code</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">IaC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">) approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Automation allows the team to devote more time to innovation.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">For your web-facing application, you can detect anomalies in advance using machine learning prediction, before they impact your system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">You can raise an automated security ticket if someone exposes your server to the world with HTTP port </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">80</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">You can pretty much automate the entire infrastructure and redeploy it multiple times as a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">one-click solution</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Automation also helps to prevent human error, which can occur even if a person is doing the same job repetitively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Automation is now a must-have for IT operations.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Operational optimization is an ongoing process whereby continuous effort is required to identify </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">gaps and improve on these. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">These gaps could be focused on reliability, availability, performance, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that the architecture supports the business goals and adapts to changing needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">Achieving operational excellence is a journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">Changes are always required in all parts of your workload to maintain it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.5">For example, often, the operating systems of your server need to be updated with a security patch provided by your vendor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.6">Various software that your application uses needs version upgrades. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.7">You might need to make changes in the system to adhere to new compliance requirements.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">You should design your workload in such a way that it allows all system components to get updated regularly so the system will benefit from the latest and most significant updates available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">Automate your flow to apply small, incremental changes to avoid any significant impact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Any changes should be reversible to restore the system’s working conditions in case of any issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.4">Incremental changes help with thorough testing and improve overall system reliability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.5">Automate any change management to avoid human error and achieve efficiency.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Often, a team overlooks documentation, which results in an outdated runbook. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">A runbook </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1202"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">provides a guide to executing a set of actions to resolve issues arising due to external or internal events. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">A lack of documentation can make your operation people-dependent, which can be risky due to team attrition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Always establish processes to keep your system operations people-independent, and document all aspects.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">In the runbook, you want to keep track of all previous events and actions taken by team members to resolve them so that any new team members can quickly resolve similar incidents during operation support.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">There are tools and services available that crawl through your system by scanning logs and system activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">These tools offer a fundamental set of assessments that suggest enhancements for the system’s environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">They assist in forming priorities by providing key insights and recommendations for optimization.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">After identifying and understanding the priorities, you need to design the operation, which includes the workloads to design and build the procedures to support them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">The design of a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1205"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">workload should encompass its implementation, deployment, updating process, and operational strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">An entire workload can be viewed as various application components, infrastructure components, security, data governance, and operations automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.3">After operation design, create a checklist for operational readiness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.4">These checklists should be comprehensive to ensure the system is ready for operation support when going live in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.5">This includes logging and monitoring, a communication plan, an alert mechanism, the team skillset, a team support charter, a vendor support mechanism, and so on.</span></p>
