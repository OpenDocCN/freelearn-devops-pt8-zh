    recommend that you try out with Amazon EMR, as well as with Amazon Redshift. First
    up, EMRFS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We briefly touched upon the topic of EMRFS while deciding which filesystem to
    opt for when it comes to deploying the EMR Cluster. **EMR File System** (**EMRFS**)
    is an implementation of the traditional HDFS that allows for reading and writing
    files from Amazon EMR directly to Amazon S3\. This essentially allows you to leverage
    the consistency provided by S3, as well as some of its other feature sets, such
    as data encryption. To read more about EMRFS and how you can use it for your EMR
    clusters, visit: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, Amazon EMR also provides an enterprise-grade Hadoop distribution in
    the form of MapR. The MapR distribution of Hadoop provides you with a plethora
    of features that enhances your overall experience when it comes to building distributed
    applications, as well as managing the overall Hadoop cluster. For example, selecting
    MapR as the Hadoop distribution provides support for industry-standard interfaces,
    such as NFS and ODBC, using which you can connect your EMR cluster with any major
    BI tool, including Tableau and Toad. MapR internally also provides built-in high
    availability, data protection, higher performances, and a whole list of additional
    features. You can read more about the MapR distribution for Hadoop at EMR at: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-mapr.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-mapr.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last but not the least, I would also recommend that you try out some of Amazon
    Redshift's advanced features in the form of reserved nodes and parameter groups.
    Parameter groups are essentially a group of parameters that are applied to the
    database when it is created. You can find the parameter group for your existing
    database by selecting the Parameter Group option from the Redshift's navigation
    pane. You can use and tweak these parameter groups based on your requirements
    to fine tune and customize the database. To know how to leverage parameter groups
    for your database tuning, visit: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-parameter-groups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-parameter-groups.html).

    by AWS for big data analytics followed by a quick getting started with Amazon
    EMR guide. We learnt about a few of Amazon EMR's concepts as well as launched
    our very first EMR cluster, as well. We also ran our first simple job on the EMR
    cluster and learnt how to monitor its performance using the likes of Amazon CloudWatch.

    core concepts and workings. We also created our first Redshift cluster, connected
    to it using an open source client and ran a couple of SQL queries, as well.
