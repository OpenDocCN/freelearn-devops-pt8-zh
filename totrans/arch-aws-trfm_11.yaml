    to work on the same code base while keeping track of changes and collaborating
    on code. A Git workflow is a set of guidelines that dictate how developers use
    Git to manage the code base.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are several Git workflows, but the most common one is a **Gitflow** workflow.
    A Gitflow workflow is a branching model that provides a clear separation of development
    branches and release branches. It consists of two main branches:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Master branch**: The master branch represents the official code base, and
    it should always contain a stable, working version of the code.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Developers create feature branches off the develop branch, make changes to the
    code, and then merge their changes back into the develop branch.'

    that developers can use, depending on their needs and preferences. Here are some
    of the most common Git workflows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Centralized workflow**: In a centralized workflow, all developers work on
    a single master branch, and changes are made directly to the master branch. While
    this workflow is simple and straightforward, it can lead to conflicts and make
    it difficult to manage changes in the code base.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Feature branch workflow**: In a feature branch workflow, developers create
    a new branch for each feature they work on. Once the feature is complete, they
    merge the changes back into the main branch. This workflow can be useful for teams
    that need to work on multiple features simultaneously.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Forking workflow**: In a forking workflow, each developer creates their own
    copy of the repository, known as a fork. They make changes to the code base in
    their fork and then submit a pull request to the main repository to merge their
    changes. This workflow is often used for open source projects where contributions
    come from many different developers.'
