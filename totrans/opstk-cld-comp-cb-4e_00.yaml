- en: 'OpenStack is the open source software for building public and private clouds,
    and privately hosted software-defined infrastructure services. It is a global
    open source success and is developed and supported by thousands of people around
    the globe and backed by leading players in the cloud space today. This book is
    specifically designed to quickly help you get up to speed with OpenStack and give
    you the confidence and understanding to roll it out into your own datacenters.
    This book covers an installation of OpenStack using Ansible, into your datacenters,
    in addition to providing steps for running under so that you can quickly gain
    the knowledge needed to install and operate OpenStack today. This book has been
    written by four principal level OpenStack engineers and architects from Rackspace,
    and it covers a wide range of topics that help you install and configure your
    OpenStack environments. This book will guide you in the following things:'
