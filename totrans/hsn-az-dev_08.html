<p>Logic Apps are one main enterprise-level integration services and let us automate processes as workflows across the organization. They allow for the simple connection of different services and applications with multiple connectors. Further, by leveraging a serverless model, they reduce costs and shorten the time needed for developing a working solution.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Azure Logic Apps is and how it works</li>
<li>Connectors for Logic Apps</li>
<li>Creating a Logic App and integrating it with other services</li>
<li><span>B2B integration </span>and how works</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you need to integrate multiple services and automate tasks such as sending an email, creating a file, or generating a report based on some input data (maybe a database table or a social media feed). If you work with a specific cloud vendor (in this particular case, Microsoft Azure), it could be crucial to be able to rapidly develop workflows that can be versioned and are natively integrated with multiple cloud services, using a tool that does not require learning many different concepts to get started. Such a service is Azure Logic Apps, which you will learn about in this chapter.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the previous chapter, you learned about Azure Functions, which required a trigger to be executed. The situation is similar with Azure Logic Apps—you need to define specific criteria that tell the runtime when a Logic App instance should be executed. During the execution, even more actions are performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data is converted so it meets initial requirements</li>
<li>All conditional flows are executed so one specific execution flow is evaluated</li>
<li>Temporary variables are assigned values</li>
</ul>
<p>The following shows an example of a flow that is executed each day and sets a variable that is used to remove outdated blobs:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/64e477ce-1ef4-477e-b82e-9c6c5530e90e.png" style="width:40.25em;height:32.33em;" width="622" height="500"/></p>
<p>As you can see, it contains three different blocks, which are the initial part of the flow (in fact, the whole workflow is much bigger as it contains a loop and different conditions and actions—we will cover all of these later):</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one defines how often an instance of a Logic App should be executed</li>
<li>The second one defines a variable, which is used by the next steps—it specifies the maximum age of a file in Azure Blob Storage </li>
<li>The third one feeds the next step (a <kbd>for each</kbd> loop) with a list of available blobs within a specific storage account and container</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably noticed one more thing—the workflow is built using graphical blocks, which can be connected by defining multiple relations. While such a solution is a real handful when creating and modifying Logic Apps, it could be problematic when versioning and developing within a team. Fortunately, each flow is also defined in JSON:</p>
<pre>{<br/>    "$connections": {<br/>        "value": {<br/>            "azureblob": {<br/>                "connectionId": "/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourceGroups/handsonazure-rg/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/azureblob",<br/>                "connectionName": "azureblob",<br/>                "id": "/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/westeurope/managedApis/azureblob"<br/>            }<br/>        }<br/>    },<br/>    "definition": {<br/>        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",<br/>        "actions": {<br/>            "For_each": {<br/>                "actions": {<br/>                    "Condition": {<br/>                        "actions": {<br/>                            "Delete_blob": {<br/>  <br/>  (...)<br/>              }<br/>            }<br/>          }<br/>        }<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p>Thanks to such a representation, you can add your Logic Apps to any version control systems (for example, Git or SVN) and modify them when you wish. Additionally, you can automate the creation of different Logic Apps by generating code files on-the-fly.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You may wonder what the real use case for Azure Logic Apps is when you have other possibilities available (Azure Functions and custom workflows). If you take a closer look at its features, you will notice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not have to be a cloud developer to develop workflows—even less advanced users (for example, IT professionals, IT admins, and data scientists) can create the one they need without learning <span>much</span> about this particular service</li>
<li>You do not worry about scaling—as Azure Logic Apps are also a part of serverless services available in Azure, you focus on delivering business value rather than server configuration and capabilities</li>
<li>In general, you do not have to write code—however, you are not limited to a "codeless" environment as it is possible to host it within Azure Functions and just execute it on demand</li>
<li>You are able to implement B2B integration, which leverages enterprise standards relating to exchanging messages and communication, such as AS2 or EDIFACT</li>
</ul>
<p>The following shows the current pricing for Azure Logic Apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each action costs <span>$0.000025 per execution</span></li>
<li>Each connector costs <span>$0.000125 per execution</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To fully understand it, we have to describe those two terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: This is each step executed after a trigger (for example, listing files, calling an API, or setting a variable)</li>
<li><strong>Connector</strong>: This is a binding to multiple external services (Azure Service Bus, SFTP, or Twitter), which you will use in your workflows</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that Azure Logic Apps could be quite expensive when performing complicated workflows very often. In such scenarios, consider using other services (such as Azure Functions), which of course require much more time spent on developing but, on the other hand, offer better pricing.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>The main concept of Azure Logic Apps is connectors. Connectors are both actions and triggers that you can use in your workflows to fetch data, transform it, and extend the current capabilities of your applications. Currently, Azure Logic Apps have 200 different connectors <span>available</span>, which allow you to integrate with multiple Azure services (such as Azure API Management or Azure Functions), other systems (OneDrive and Salesforce), and even on-premises systems.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In Azure Logic Apps, connectors are divided into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Built-in</strong> <strong>connectors</strong>: These are designed to work with Azure services and create workflows and are organized around handling application logic and working with data</li>
<li><strong>Managed</strong> <strong>connectors</strong>: These connectors ease integration with other systems and services</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed connectors are divided into even more detailed groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed API connectors</li>
<li>On-premises connectors</li>
<li>Integration account connectors</li>
<li>Enterprise connectors</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we will go through multiple examples of different types of connector so you will be able to understand their use cases and functionality.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Built-in connectors</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The following shows examples of built-in connectors that you can use in your Azure Logic Apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>: For running Logic Apps on a specific schedule or pausing their executions</li>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong>: For communicating with endpoints over the HTTP protocol</li>
<li><strong>Request</strong>: For making a Logic App callable from other services or sending responses</li>
<li><strong>Batch</strong>: For processing messages in batches</li>
<li><strong>Azure Functions</strong>: For running custom code snippets</li>
<li><strong>Azure API Management</strong>: For integrating triggers and actions defined by other services</li>
<li><strong>Azure App Services</strong>: For calling API apps and web apps</li>
<li><strong>Azure Logic Apps</strong>: For calling other Logic Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we have here more generic connectors (schedule, HTTP, and request) and those specific to a service (such as Azure Functions or Azure App Services). In general, these connectors are the foundation of most Azure Logic Apps—when it comes to creating workflows, we very often require to call an API or perform various other HTTP requests.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that each connector has detailed documentation available describing its use cases and how you can develop workflows with it. You can find a link to it in the <em>Further reading</em><strong> </strong>section in this chapter.</div>

<p>When using managed API connectors, you will be able to integrate with services and systems that require configuring a connection; these can be used when executing an instance of a Logic App. The following shows an example of a Logic App in a resource group with an additional resource defined as the API connection:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/7b37b43f-9d7c-47ea-8941-2373869c4962.png" width="1035" height="440"/></p>
<p>In the documentation, plenty of different API connectors are described—let's review some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Service Bus</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>Office 365 Outlook</li>
<li>Azure Blob Storage</li>
<li>SFTP</li>
<li>SharePoint Online</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, with these connectors we have access to a variety of different Azure services and other systems (here, Office 365 and SharePoint), which can be leveraged in your workflows to extend your application's logic. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>As I described previously, with Azure Logic Apps you are able to also integrate with on-premises services such as different database systems (Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server), business analytics systems (Teradata), or file systems.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To access on-premises data, you will have to create a resource called an on-premises data gateway.

<p>Azure Logic Apps also lets you build so-called B2B solutions using integration accounts and leveraging a variety of advanced connectors such as XML Transforms and X12 encoding/decoding or even accessing enterprise systems such as the SAP. While, for most users, these capabilities are not that useful (as these are rather advanced topics that most people are not familiar with), being able to build Logic Apps that allow for seamless communication between partners is an interesting functionality. We will cover more about B2B integration within Azure Logic Apps at the end of this chapter. </p>

<p>To create an instance of a Logic App, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">+ Create a resource</span><strong> </strong>and search for <span class="packt_screen">Logic App</span>. When you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create </span>button, you will see a simple form that allows you to create a new instance of a Logic App:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6a4a7799-0957-41e5-bad4-31d2c3e56fa5.png" style="width:26.83em;height:30.67em;" width="483" height="551"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="2">
<li>In fact, the only extra thing you are able to configure here is enabling Azure Log Analytics. Since this particular service will not be covered in this book, I will skip it in this chapter. When you click on the <span class="packt_screen">OK </span>button, Azure will start the creation of a new Logic App.</li>
<li>When the creation is finished, you can go to the service to check what it initially looks like:</li>
</ol>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now you can click on the <span class="packt_screen">Logic App Designer</span><strong> </strong>button on the left to access a new blade that enables you to create a brand new workflow. Initially, you will see plenty of different templates available—it is a great start if you are now familiar with this particular service as it displays many different possibilities and configurations that you may achieve using Azure Logic Apps. To get started, in the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Templates</strong></span> section, select the <span class="packt_screen">Schedule</span> option in the <span class="packt_screen">Category</span> drop-down menu and choose <span class="packt_screen">Scheduler - Add message to queue</span>:</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>When you click on <span class="packt_screen">Use this template</span>, you will see a designer window where you will be able to finish configuring a workflow. Note that, initially, we do not see all blocks—we have to set all missing configuration values (such as <span class="packt_screen">Queue Name</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Message</span>) before we can proceed. Once everything is set up and ready, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>, which will allow you to work on your workflow:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>To finish configuration, you will have to enter all missing values—the queue name and message. Once you do this, you have saved a Logic App and can now try to run it.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">This particular connector does not create a queue if it does not exist. Make sure you have one before starting a Logic App instance. If you do not know how to do so, refer to <a href="6feb3822-0662-46c8-b889-c038672a1ad1.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Using Azure Storage - Tables, Queues, Files, and Blobs</em><span>, </span>where we discuss Azure Storage features and queues.</div>
<p>If you click on the <span class="packt_screen">Run </span>button, you will be able to see how the full flow was executed:</p>

<p>We can compare the preceding execution with a failed one so that you can see the difference between them (such as message content or a dynamic variable created during the execution of a flow). Logic Apps can be debugged really quickly as they provide detailed error messages and directly point you to the place where something is wrong:</p>

<p>While it is perfectly fine to with your Logic Apps using Azure Portal, you do not always want to log in and use its UI. As it is possible to install an extension to Microsoft Visual Studio, which enables you to work with Azure Logic Apps, we will try to check how it work in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>To start working with your Logic Apps in Visual Studio you will have to open the <span class="packt_screen">Cloud Explorer</span><strong> </strong>(<span class="packt_screen">View</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Cloud Explorer</span>) window. It will display a list of available subscriptions and resources within it.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This is the main view and allows you to start working with that particular Azure component. When you click on an instance you are interested in, you will see the additional menu, available below the displayed resources.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">You can also right-click on the resource you would like to work with—it will display a menu with available actions.</div>

<p>You can work with your Logic App in Visual Studio in the same manner as you would work in Azure Portal. Additionally, you can take a look at its history and disable and delete it.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">When you double-click on an item in the run history, you will get the very same view as in Azure Portal, where you were able to debug a particular invocation. This is very helpful as you can quickly develop and test your Logic Apps and work on other parts of your application without leaving your IDE.</div>
<p>I strongly encourage you to play a little bit with Azure Logic Apps by yourself in Visual Studio as this is a great addition to the whole service, and has the same feeling as the portal.</p>

<p>To a slight extent, we have already covered B2B integration of Azure Logic Apps in this chapter, but I wanted to give you some more information regarding this topic, as this service is not always recognized as an enterprise integration tool. Surprisingly, Azure Logic Apps has many interesting features to offer when it comes to exchanging messages and data between partners and you'll find the relevant details in this section.</p>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Starting B2B integration in Azure Logic Apps</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To get started with B2B integration, you will need an <span class="packt_screen">Integration Account</span>—this is a special container for integration artifacts you will work with. In general, it allows you to store a variety of different items (certificates, schemas, and agreements) in one place, so you can work with them in Azure Logic Apps.</p>
<p>To create such an account, click on the <span class="packt_screen">+ Create a resource </span>and search for <span class="packt_screen">Integration Account</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0ecddcca-e87c-47ac-af61-4294ed5e02c1.png" style="width:34.50em;height:30.83em;" width="564" height="504"/></p>
<p>As you can see it offers a simple form where, in fact, the only thing you need to do is select the proper <span class="packt_screen">Pricing Tier</span>.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">The selected tier changes the maximum number of stored artifacts. You can, of course, change it later.</div>
<p>Once you have an integration account instance, you will need to link it with your Logic App. To do so, go to the <span class="packt_screen">Workflow settings</span><strong> </strong>blade in your instance of Azure Logic Apps and search for the <span class="packt_screen">Integration account</span> section:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/23e90c35-bfdc-40e6-88c1-4d1744259ce5.png" style="width:45.00em;height:12.25em;" width="617" height="168"/></div>
<p>Now you should be able to use connectors, which require an integration account to work.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Normally, if your Logic App has no integration account linked, when you add a step requiring such functionality, you will have to provide a custom name. Once such a connection is available, you will not be asked for additional information again. </div>
<p>In the <em>Further reading</em> section of this chapter, you will find additional links that will help you gather more information regarding B2B integration in Azure Logic Apps.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you have learned about Azure Logic Apps, a simple yet useful service whose use isn't restricted to Azure ninjas. You read about different connectors and multiple ways of working with your Logic Apps—using both Azure Portal (with designed and code editor) and Visual Studio. Additionally, you should know something about B2B integration in that service and how to start it.</p>
