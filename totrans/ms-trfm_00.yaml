- en: Infrastructure as Code has emerged as the de facto method for provisioning and
    maintaining cloud infrastructure. While this approach has been around for a while,
    it has matured and refined over the years. Initially, it followed largely imperative
    programming models and employed agents to facilitate change. However, with the
    advent of API-based cloud services, it has transformed into a primarily declarative
    configuration of desired states that are translated into cloud services and their
    configuration—of which Terraform is the gold standard.

- en: Terraform is crucial for both application development teams, who create applications
    and services that delight end users, and platform teams, who empower enterprises
    and organizations with smooth and efficient operations. As a result, Terraform
    has become the preferred way for these teams to build and manage the environments
    that support their goals.

- en: This book, *Mastering Terraform*, recognizes that to truly master Terraform,
    one must first have a deep understanding of the cloud services and architectures
    that will be automated through the use of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code.
    Throughout this book, the focus will be on solving real-world problems—whether
    by building new environments or managing existing ones—using Terraform.

    Azure, and Google Cloud—will receive equal treatment within this book. No matter
    which of these clouds you plan on working with—one, two, or all of them—this book
    will treat you as a first-class citizen.

    in the tool shed. Practitioners often need to integrate multiple tools to accomplish
    their goals. Therefore, we’ll explore three different cloud computing paradigms:
    virtual machines, containers, and serverless. Each has its own design characteristics,
    deployment mechanics, and toolchain dynamics that you need to be aware of when
    working with them.'

- en: This book is intended for cloud, DevOps, platform, and infrastructure engineers,
    SREs, developers, and cloud architects who want to use Terraform to automate cloud
    infrastructures and streamline software delivery. You will benefit from having
    a basic understanding of Infrastructure as Code (such as Terraform, Ansible, and
    AWS CDK), cloud architecture, development tools, and platforms. This foundation
    will help you elevate your skills through the concepts and practices covered in
    the book.
