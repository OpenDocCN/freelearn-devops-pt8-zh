			<p>We are living in a world of such big and rapid changes. In the IT industry, things such as <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>, <strong class="bold">the cloud</strong>, <strong class="bold">digital transformation</strong>, <strong class="bold">containers</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong> have emerged in the last few years and dramatically changed the way we develop, build, test, and deploy applications.</p>
			<p>Among the big set of new technologies, only a few of them have become a sort of <em class="italic">consensus</em> in the industry, including the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes. Over the last few years, the authors of this book have worked with many customers that are on this cloud and container adoption journey – <em class="italic">almost all of them have adopted some sort of Kubernetes distribution and one or more cloud providers</em>. Most of them are <em class="italic">experiencing the benefits</em> of this adoption but also have to deal with <em class="italic">many new challenges</em>, such as <em class="italic">maintaining standard environments, keeping them secure, and keeping costs under control</em>.</p>
			<p>That is why we decided to focus this book not <em class="italic">only</em> on OpenShift, which is one of the market leaders in enterprise Kubernetes, but <em class="italic">also</em> on <strong class="bold">multi-cluster management</strong>. This book is the result of <em class="italic">years of experience in the field</em>, designing architectures and deploying and operating OpenShift clusters, which we have tried to turn into words, pages, and chapters!</p>
			<p>We are going to cover in this book answers to questions such as, <em class="italic">what are the different architectural choices I have with OpenShift? How do I design the right architecture for my case? What are the different personas related to OpenShift, their main responsibilities, and their challenges?</em> We will also walk through <strong class="bold">OpenShift deployment, troubleshooting, network, and security</strong>. <strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitOps</strong> are also covered in this book with some <em class="italic">practical examples</em> that you can use to learn how they can help you to increase the maturity level of your build and deployment process. Finally, we will go over some tools, such as <strong class="bold">Advanced Cluster Management</strong> and <strong class="bold">Advanced Cluster Security</strong>, that will help you to <em class="italic">manage and secure multiple OpenShift clusters from a central standpoint</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended to be helpful for any professional that is involved with Kubernetes and OpenShift. It is especially useful for software engineers, infrastructure operators, developers, site reliability engineers, and security engineers, but should also be relevant to enterprise architects and CXO decision makers. Are you interested in knowing more about OpenShift architecture, deployment, security, GitOps, pipelines, multi-cluster management, and security? <em class="italic">If so, this book was carefully made for you!</em></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, you will run commands and use command-line tools. We recommend you use a Mac or Linux workstation, such as Fedora or Ubuntu – although some of the CLI tools also have versions for Windows, the command examples used in this book assume the usage of a Linux workstation, and Mac should also work fine.</p>
			<p>For some sections of this book, an AWS account is necessary; however, it should not be difficult to adapt the examples for other cloud providers. You can sign up for a free trial on AWS here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>.</p>
