    and reusable Puppet code in the form of classes and defined types. We discussed
    that almost all Puppet resources should be separated into appropriate classes,
    except if they logically need to be part of a defined type. This is almost enough
    syntax to build manifests for an entire fleet of agent nodes; each selecting the
    appropriate composite classes, which in turn include further required classes,
    with all the classes recursively instantiating the defined types.

    and defined types that contribute to a common management goal (specific system
    aspects or a piece of software, for example). These manifests are not all that
    is organized through modules; most modules also bundle files and file templates.
    There can also be several kinds of Puppet plugins in a module. This section will
    explain these different parts of a module and show you where they are located.

    The manifests consist of classes and defined types, which all share a namespace,
    rooted at the module name. For example, an `ntp` module will contain only classes
    and defines whose names start with the `ntp::` prefix.

    is often used for configuration files or snippets. You have seen examples of this,

    module. It has been prepared to provide generally suitable configuration data.
    However, there is often the need to tweak some parameters inside such a file,
    so that the node manifests can declare customized config settings for the respective
    agent. The tool of choice for this is templates, which will be discussed in [Chapter

    There are also **parser functions** (also called **custom functions**), for one.

    for the master to pick them up. Each module forms a directory tree. Its root is
    named after the module itself. For example, the `ntp` module is stored in a directory
    called `ntp/`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    defined type has its own respective file. The `ntp::package` class will be found
    in `manifests/package.pp`, and the defined type called `ntp::monitoring::nagios`
    will be found in `manifests/monitoring/nagios.pp`. The first particle of the container
    name (`ntp`) is always the module name, and the rest describes the location under
    `manifests/`. You can refer to the module tree in the following paragraphs for
    more examples.

    the master and the agent in the according namespaces. There are examples for all

    Puppet to manage a diverse server infrastructure, there are likely modules for
    each respective service, such as `apache`, `ssh`, `nagios`, `nginx`, and so forth.
    Most of these modules will be taken from an upstream development and are referred
    to as "technical component modules". There can also be site-specific modules,
    such as `users` or `shell_settings,` if the operations require this kind of fine-grained
    control. Such customized modules are sometimes just named after the group or the
    company that owns them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ideal granularity depends on the individual requirements of your setup.
    What you generally want to avoid are modules with names such as `utilities` or
    `helpers,` which serve as a melting pot for ideas that don't fit in any of the
    existing modules. Such a lack of organization can be detrimental to discipline
    and can lead to chaotic modules that include definitions that should have become
    their own respective modules instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding more modules is cheap. A module generally incurs no cost for the Puppet
    master operation, and your user experience will usually become more efficient
    with more modules, not less so. Of course, this balance can tip if your site imposes
    special documentation or other handling prerequisites on each module. Such rulings
    must then be weighed into the decisions about module organization.

    and will merely present the respective line of output to you instead. There is

    The latter might appear if the users prefer uppercase in their manifest. Both
    values just become `:tcp` through munging. For the IP address, invoking `downcase`
    has an effect only for IPv6.
