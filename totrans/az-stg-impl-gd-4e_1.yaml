  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It provides a variety of services
    to both individuals and organizations. Cloud computing enables convenient, on-demand
    access to a shared pool of computing resources over the network. These resources
    can range from storage and servers to applications that can be deployed rapidly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure provides rapid provisioning of compute resources to help you host your
    existing applications, streamline new application development, and even enhance
    on-premises applications. These resources are managed by Microsoft; however, you
    can monitor them and get reports and alerts when issues arise. This is all built
    on top of resource pools that can be dynamically assigned to the required services,
    which can include CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are four categories of service models offered by Azure, which are **Infrastructure
    as a Service** (**IaaS**), **Software as a Service** (**SaaS**), **Platform as
    a Service** (**PaaS**), and Serverless. Azure IaaS is an instant computing infrastructure
    that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand and
    is provisioned and managed over the internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It is critical to understand how you can leverage each of these service models
    to meet your ever-changing demands. When you use Azure, you have a shared responsibility
    with regard to the resources you deploy. In *Figure 1.1*, you can see the extent
    to which you share and manage workload responsibilities with Microsoft for each
    of the service models, allowing you to focus on resources that are important for
    your application:'

    what Azure manages, you can determine which cloud service model works best for
    your organization. Different models afford you different degrees of control over
    the development environment, the ability to refactor your apps, your time-to-market
    goals, and so on. Your responsibilities generally increase as you move from SaaS
    to PaaS to IaaS. The separation of responsibilities will be covered in depth in
    *Chapter 2, Automation and governance in Azure*, in the *Identity and access control*
    section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the most control over the environment as Microsoft provides the foundational infrastructure
    while you manage the applications. This approach is great for organizations that
    are looking to customize their cloud solutions for their business applications.

    choose from different ways to deploy cloud services—public cloud, private cloud,
    hybrid cloud, multiple clouds, and at the edge of networks. Deciding between these
    computing environments can depend on a variety of factors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common type of cloud computing service is a public cloud, which is
    provided by third-party cloud providers and delivered over the public internet.
    The resources in these public cloud environments are owned and managed by the
    underlying cloud provider, which in the case of Azure is Microsoft. In public
    clouds, resources are shared with other organizations or cloud tenants; these
    can include services such as email, CRM, VMs, and databases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some common public cloud use cases involve organizations who want to expose
    their public workloads, such as public websites or mobile apps. These types of
    applications have workloads with multiple layers of UI and services in order for
    them to function. A good example of this is Microsoft's Office products on different
    platforms, such as desktop, web, and mobile. These offerings are accomplished
    with the UI being separate from the services, with each implementation using the
    services and cloud infrastructure behind the scenes to deliver the same experience
    regardless of the platform.

    and software—used exclusively by one business or organization, with both services
    and infrastructure being maintained on a private network. A third-party service
    provider can host a private cloud, or it can be located at an on-site datacenter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions,
    or healthcare providers to meet specific regulatory and IT requirements with business-critical
    operations seeking enhanced control over their environment. On-premises environments
    can expand to Azure by using Azure ExpressRoute or a site-to-site VPN tunnel to
    connect workloads while keeping them isolated from public view. We will take a
    deeper look into these core Azure infrastructure components in *Chapter 5, Enabling
    secure, remote work with Microsoft Azure AD and WVD.*

- en: A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines an on-premises datacenter
    with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    Hybrid clouds allow businesses to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure
    into the cloud when processing demand increases and scale back that infrastructure
    when demand decreases. Hybrid cloud also allows the flexibility to use new cloud-first
    technologies for new or migrated workloads while keeping other business-critical
    applications and data on-premises due to migration costs and business or regulatory
    compliance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To illustrate, let's think about a tax company scenario. Tax companies generally
    need large compute only three months out of the year, which can be costly. Rather
    than investing a large amount of capital in additional on-premises servers to
    support peak capacity, they can use a hybrid environment in the cloud to expand
    and contract their compute on demand. This would allow them to keep costs down
    by only paying for what they use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure offers unique hybrid capabilities that give customers the flexibility
    to innovate anywhere, whether on-premises, across clouds, or in edge environments.
    There are different hybrid usage models in Azure that can help you reduce the
    cost of running your workloads in the cloud. For example, Azure Hybrid Benefit
    lets you bring your existing on-premises server licenses to Azure to maximize
    cost savings. This is referred to as the Hybrid licensing model and applies to
    most server-based licensing.

    Cloud for Financial Services, Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing, and Microsoft
    Cloud for Nonprofit. These industry clouds marry the whole range of Microsoft's
    cloud services with industry-specific components and standards, workflows, and
    APIs to provide tailored solutions to industry challenges, so businesses can target
    the areas that require technological transformation the most.

    from more than one cloud provider. This allows you to mix and match services from
    different providers to get the best combination for a particular task or capitalize
    on offerings in specific locations, whether they are public or private clouds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, customers may choose a multicloud strategy to meet regulatory
    or data sovereignty requirements in different countries. This may also be done
    to improve business continuity and disaster recovery, for example, backing up
    on-premises data in two public clouds for business units, subsidiaries, or acquired
    companies that adopt different cloud platforms.

    multiple platforms. Microsoft Azure provides solutions to help you operate your
    hybrid cloud seamlessly, which you can read about at [https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-app/](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-app/).
    One such solution is Azure Arc, a multicloud management technology. Azure Arc
    extends Azure management and services with a single control plane across hybrid,
    multicloud, and edge environments, enabling a consistent state across resource
    environments and infrastructure. It provides greater visibility of resources,
    team accountability, and developer empowerment while accelerating innovation from
    Azure to any location.

    devices. At edge locations, close to where the data resides, you can run virtual
    machines, data services, and containers using edge computing to gain insights
    in real time and reduce latency. At the edge of the network, your devices spend
    less time communicating with the cloud and operate reliably even through extended
    offline periods.

    cloud technologies such as machine learning and AI, means IoT devices are highly
    responsive to local changes and are contextually aware. There are also security
    benefits given the distributed nature of edge computing systems, which makes it
    difficult for a single disruption to compromise the entire network.

    These IoT tracking devices send a significant amount of telemetry data when they
    are connected to the internet and store this data locally in the absence of a
    connection. This has allowed the UNDP to move and manage its fleet of vehicles

    infrastructure to the cloud, moving either some of their workloads for a hybrid
    cloud approach, or the entire infrastructure—this is referred to as *migration*.
    From migrating legacy applications to deploying applications on Azure, organizations
    need to determine their requirements beforehand and plan a migration strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    considerations. The first is which type of deployment model you''d like to use:
    public Azure, private cloud, hybrid Azure, or multicloud. The second is the service
    category or type: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, or Serverless. These migration strategies
    will help you understand which approach may be optimal for moving your workloads
    to Azure.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Re-hosting, or lifting and shifting, is the process of taking an on-premises
    application host or VM and moving it directly to Azure. It is the fastest and
    easiest way to move because it has the fewest dependencies, the lowest business
    impact, and no constraints. Re-hosting your application is recommended in scenarios
    where speed of delivery is needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Re-platforming, or redeploying, is when you want to take something like the
    **Internet Information Services** (**IIS**) on a VM and move it out to a PaaS
    offering in Azure. This means you won't need to manage the OS, just the application
    itself. It can generally be performed by simply redirecting your DevOps process
    to redeploy to the new infrastructure, though there can be third-party DLLs and
    restrictions that may cause problems in this scenario.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Refactoring
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Refactoring is generally recommended when your application code isn't compliant
    with Azure services. It requires you to rewrite the application, or parts of the
    application, to conform to the ever-evolving new standards, as well as functional
    and security needs. It is also referred to as *modernization* of the app because
    you are making it more Azure native. Of the three strategies for moving to Azure,
    this one has the potential to have cost-overrun risk.
