  zh: 分析功能需求（FRs）
- en: At the onset of any project, defining business requirements is fundamental to
    solution design. These requirements, initially presented in basic form, necessitate
    the involvement of a varied group from the start, including those with technical
    expertise, to accurately identify and understand these requirements. Business
    stakeholders initially set these requirements, but as the project technologically
    evolves, frequent adjustments are often required. This is where the role of a
    solutions architect becomes pivotal, not just in designing the application but
    also in shaping the overall business outcome.

  zh: 在任何项目的开始，定义业务需求是解决方案设计的基础。这些需求最初以基本形式呈现，要求从一开始就需要一个多样化的团队参与，其中包括具有技术专长的人，以准确识别和理解这些需求。最初由业务利益相关者设定这些需求，但随着项目的技术演进，通常需要进行频繁调整。这时，解决方案架构师的角色至关重要，不仅仅是在设计应用程序方面，还在于塑造整体的业务结果。
- en: Solutions architects go beyond technical expertise, integrating deep business
    insights to align technology with business goals. They work closely with product
    managers and stakeholders, bridging FRs with technical solutions and becoming
    trusted advisors. Their role is crucial in visualizing the end product and its
    implementation, guiding projects to not only meet technical specifications but
    also fulfill strategic business objectives and meet user expectations.

  zh: 解决方案架构师不仅具备技术专长，还融合了深刻的商业洞察力，将技术与商业目标对接。他们与产品经理和利益相关者紧密合作，将功能需求（FRs）与技术解决方案连接起来，成为值得信赖的顾问。这个角色对于可视化最终产品及其实现至关重要，指导项目不仅满足技术规范，还能够实现战略商业目标，并符合用户期望。
- en: In essence, the role of a solutions architect transcends traditional boundaries
    of technical expertise. They are pivotal in bridging the gap between technical
    possibilities and business realities, ensuring that the final solution not only
    adheres to technical specifications but also delivers real business value. Their
    ability to work with a diverse set of stakeholders, understand the nuances of
    business needs, and foresee potential challenges makes them indispensable in the
    journey from conceptualization to the realization of a project. The success of
    a project often hinges on their capacity to translate complex requirements into
    a coherent, functional, and efficient solution architecture.

- en: FRs specify what a system should do, detailing the behaviors, functions, and
    features the application must support. They are directly related to the user interactions
    and tasks the application will perform. NFRs, on the other hand, define how a
    system performs certain functions, outlining the system’s quality attributes,
    such as performance, usability, reliability, and security. These requirements
    describe the system’s operation conditions and constraints that affect the user
    experience but not the specific behaviors. Let’s learn more about NFRs and how
    solution architects help to uncover them.

    stakeholders to ensure the success of a project. They need to understand the project
    requirements from various perspectives, which necessitates engaging with a diverse
    group of stakeholders. This includes translating complex technical concepts for
    non-technical stakeholders and ensuring the technical team understands the business
    objectives. By collaborating with all involved parties, the solutions architect
    ensures that the technical solution aligns with the broader business goals. This
    broad collaboration is essential for developing a comprehensive and effective

- en: Solutions architects possess excellent communication skills and negotiation
    techniques, which help them to ascertain the optimal path for a solution while
    keeping everyone on board. A solutions architect works as a liaison between technical
    and non-technical resources and fills the communication gap. Often, those communication
    gaps between a businessperson and the technical team become a reason for failure.
    The businessperson tries to look at things from more of a feature and functionality
    perspective, while the development team strives to build a more technically compatible
    solution, which may sometimes lean toward the non-functional side of the project.
