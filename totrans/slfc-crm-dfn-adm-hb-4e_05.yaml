    are used to verify that the data entered in a record meets the criteria you have
    specified before the record can be saved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validation rules contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in
    one or more fields and returns a value of either `true` or `false`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The logic that is used for validation rules is to seek an error condition, upon
    which a pre-configured error message is shown to the user whenever the formula
    or expression returns a value of `true`.

    date must occur after today's date. As stated you can choose to display the error
    message at the top of the page or near a field which you can select; this can
    be the field that is causing the validation rule to fire, which is typical, or
    you can choose a different field. Like all other Salesforce error messages, validation
    rule errors are displayed in red text and are preceded by the word `Error`.

- en: Validation rules apply to all new and updated records for an object. If your
    organization has multiple page layouts for the object on which you create a validation
    rule, you should verify that the validation rule operates as expected on each
    layout. Also, if you have any data integrations that affect the object, then you
    should also verify that the validation rule operates as intended.

    and 11 GB for file storage. In total, this 12 GB storage amount (1 GB for data
    plus 11 GB for files) is the minimum total storage allocated for a Salesforce
    CRM organization. However, the storage amount increases as more active users are
    added, since there is also a 20-MB-per-user for data and 2-GB-per-user for files
    storage factor.

    criteria to prevent users from saving invalid data in one or more fields. In this
    scenario, if a user enters an invalid **Close Date** (one in the past), the error
    message defined within the validation rule is displayed on the record and the

    can be dependent picklists but cannot be controlling fields. Checkbox fields can
    be controlling fields but cannot be dependent fields. Standard picklist fields
