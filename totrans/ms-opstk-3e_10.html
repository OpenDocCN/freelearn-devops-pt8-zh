    <a id="_idIndexMarker925">
    </a>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">
     is the lack of full control over the cloud infrastructure.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">
     At first glance, the preceding diagram might seem counterintuitive.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">
     The fact that organizations are looking for a public cloud offering is mainly due to running faster time to market without the need to get their hands into the hardware details or underlying networking devices.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.4">
     That can be a fair reason to adopt the public cloud, but what about when we need the customization of the underlying hardware?
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.5">
     As that is managed only by the vendor, consumers will not have control over it.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.6">
     That might sound odd from the first reflection, but compared to traditional on-premises models, sometimes application teams ask for certain hardware combinations with granular specifications that cannot be found in the public cloud.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.7">
     Network teams, in some edge cases, could be asked to build a network map that is not convenient in the public cloud world.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.8">
     Coming from the on-premises world, cloud consumers might have some expectations of having a certain degree of control of the underlying infrastructure that is not feasible at the beginning.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.9">
     That can turn into accepting such limitations at the cost of architecting a complex network setup.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.10">
     On the other hand, some cloud providers have responded to many customers’ requests and provided certain ways of controlling how hardware can be provisioned to run specific workloads.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.11">
     For example, AWS offers a

     Moving freely between environments and platforms is a luxury driver for many businesses to stay economical with resource usage and respond to development requirements when needed.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">
     Lock-in can take different forms.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.4">
     For example, let’s say that an organization wishes to move its workload running on a virtual machine between different cloud providers or on-premises.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.5">
     That would require a longer time for planning and testing before doing such a move, such as building a private connection between the cloud source and the environment destination(s), building the application artifact, deploying it in the target environment, and testing it.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.6">
     The good news, thanks to some amazing open source initiatives, is that containerization technology has been a rockstar that has enabled standardized application deployment to a certain degree.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.7">
     Hence, moving between environments is a matter of connecting them with a shared container registry.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.8">
     The other vendor lock-in form is the way of managing the infrastructure itself.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.9">
     We have highlighted previously how the IaC concept started shining only when the public cloud went into action.
    </span>

    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">
     If you are building a private cloud based on OpenStack either for internal usage or for potential customers, cloud operators can extend the infrastructure perimeter to combine with public cloud services to create valuable outcomes.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">
     In a hybrid model, it is a good method to create a centralized platform that manages both the private and public clouds acting as a single pane of glass.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.4">
     The platform does not need to add complexity to talk to different cloud providers’ APIs but simply an administration dashboard with proxying capabilities to route requests that span different environments.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.5">
     With an existing OpenStack environment, cloud operators can establish secured connections in high bandwidths between the OpenStack private cloud and each of the public cloud endpoints, as shown in the

     cloud and public cloud vendors needs to satisfy certain conditions to make a complete hybrid cloud picture.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">
     In this case, a business workload should be designed to run in an OpenStack environment, in the public cloud, or both.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">
     The other important condition is the readiness for data mobility between private and public clouds.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">
     That would require a good understanding of when data is allowed to be stored in public or private infrastructure.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.5">
     Some other cases would require, for example, having short-lived data in the public cloud while keeping long-lived data in a

    </span>
    <a id="_idIndexMarker951">
    </a>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">
     to be considered when running workloads in a hybrid setup is the compatibility and variation between the different types of cloud.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">
     You might run a workload between two or more different clouds supporting multiple APIs of the same kind with the same technology stack.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">
     That can be less complex to run with easier implementation.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">
     The other variation is when different clouds do not support the same kind of APIs with different types of components, such as database engines or types of hypervisors.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.5">
     In this case, more tweaking is required to increase the degree of complexity.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.6">
     The good news is that OpenStack has been designed to leverage some of the public cloud capabilities.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.7">
     The secret sauce is its rich API exposure.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.8">
     As a private cloud software, OpenStack is considered a good choice that can power the network of private and public clouds.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.9">
     OpenStack is leveraged to manage resources for other public cloud providers such as AWS.
    </span>

    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">

   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">
     This chapter exposed the hybrid cloud novelty.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.2">
     Beyond the OpenStack private cloud capacity, there is always an opportunity to reach public cloud environments and construct a hybrid environment, as we learned in this chapter.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.3">
     The latter model keeps expanding as a new cloud style as enterprises have felt the necessity to have combined cloud modes to enjoy each type of cloud’s benefits.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.4">
     We learned that recent cloud experiences have shown that a multi-cloud strategy is still not enough to fill cost gaps in addition to compliance concerns.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.5">
     The increase of the hybrid model dominance has been accompanied by more additional OpenStack private cloud implementations.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.6">
     Gaining skills to build and manage an OpenStack private cloud is one of the cornerstones to moving to a hybrid model, which is why we focused on this in this chapter.
    </span>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.7">
     Furthermore, we learned that OpenStack provides various cloud capabilities and, thanks to its rich APIs, our private cloud can integrate well into a hybrid

    <span class="No-Break">

      cloud model.

    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">
     In the next chapter, we will demonstrate how building a private cloud environment based on OpenStack will ensure a successful hybrid cloud experience in which OpenStack
