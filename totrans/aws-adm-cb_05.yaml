  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While we normally prefer the CLI (or CloudFormation) for creating AWS resources
    the wizard for creating alarms does a lot of work for you, so it is a good place
    to start. Once you know what kinds of alarms you are interested in, you can automate
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CloudWatch console is a great place to keep an eye on the performance of
    your resources. Often when looking at the metrics you might find a scenario that
    you would want to be notified of, and quickly create an alarm on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While e-mail is probably the easiest way to get started with alarms, it doesn't
    scale all that well (Do you really want more e-mail?). For very important metrics
    you might want a CloudWatch dashboard instead, or a different notification protocol/target.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from the example-lambda-function, but the process would work the same regardless
    of the metric you select.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must define a name for the alarm, and you can optionally create a description.
    One of the most important parts of the alarm is how you define the threshold that
    will trigger it. You can choose not only the value and comparison operator used
    (for example, greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=),
    and so on), but also the number of failing data points that must occur before
    the alarm is triggered. This can stop you being alerted unnecessarily for temporary
    *spikes* in metric values. In this scenario we want to know if there are *any*
    errors, so we set the value to `1`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the right-hand side you can define the check period and the statistic used
    (for example, Average, Maximum, Minimum, and so on). You can also see the recent
    history of the selected metric in the top-right corner. The red line on the graph
    is where the currently defined threshold will sit, so you can quickly see if the
    alarm would have been triggered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Actions section of the alarm, you define what action will be taken when
    triggered. While you can select an existing SNS topic, we will define a new one
    by clicking on New list. You are then prompted for the details of the new topic;
    you must give both a name and an e-mail address to subscribe to the topic.

    receiving the e-mail and clicking on the confirmation link, the status will automatically

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start by defining the metric name and namespace that the values will appear
    under. This is important because it defines how we will see the metric in the
    console and dashboards. Names should identify and describe the metric. They do
    not need to be unique, as the dimension(s) we add will take care of that (we will
    discuss this later). Namespaces are used to group similar metrics together, like
    a category. The built-in metrics appear under the namespace `AWS/`. For example,
    EC2 metrics appear under the `AWS/EC2` namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then specify a dimension for the metric. A **dimension** is a way to uniquely
    identify similar metrics. In this case we are using the instance's ID to identify
    the metric, because the metric is unique to that instance, but we will likely
    have many instances of the `MemoryUsagePercent` metric (across many EC2 instances).
    We are obtaining the instance ID by querying (via the `curl` command) the instance
    metadata service, which is accessed over HTTP on the special IP address `169.254.169.254`.
  prefs: []

    use it, for example, for display).

    is not part of the regular services in the console. Accessing it via the user
    menu hints at the special access it requires. Generally, you would configure a
    budget when you first open a new AWS account, so you don't get any surprises in
    your bill at the end of the month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you get access denied messages in the Billing dashboard, it is most likely
    because you are using an IAM user and IAM access has not been enabled. You must
    use your root account credentials (such as that you used to create the account),
    or enable IAM access. IAM access can only be enabled by the root user.
  prefs: []

    of your usage and expenses. As I performed this example in a new account, there's
    not much to see at this point. The Month-to-Date Spend by Service graph on the
    right can be particularly useful to find out what the most popular services you
    use are. This is a great place to start when trying to reduce or optimize your
    AWS spending.

- en: We then navigate to the budgets section and create a new budget. Most of the
    details should be self-explanatory, and obvious for the purposes of budgeting.
    Your main choice is to decide if you want to alert on usage or costs. Cost budgets
    work against the dollar (or appropriate billing currency) amount you will be charged.
    Usage budgets work against a selected unit of usage, for example, instance hours
    or data transfer for EC2\. A usage budget can only track one type of usage unit,
    so you will need to create multiple budgets to track the various units that you
    might be charged for. This is one reason why we prefer a cost budget, as it takes
    into account multiple forms of usage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifying e-mail addresses to alert is the simplest way to send any alerts
    from the budget. For more advanced use cases, you can specify an SNS topic to
    receive notifications. An example might be if you wanted to receive budget alerts
    on your phone via an SMS message, or send the alert to a different system automatically
    (via HTTP/JSON).
