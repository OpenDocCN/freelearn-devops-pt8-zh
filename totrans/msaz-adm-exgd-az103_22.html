<ol>
<li><span>Your company plans to release a new web application. This application is deployed using an App Service in Azure and will be available for all users of the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> domain. You have already purchased the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> domain name. You configure the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> Azure <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> zone and delegate it to the Azure DNS. You need to ensure that the web application can be accessed by using the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> domain name. You decide to use PowerShell to accomplish this. Which command should you use?<br/></span>
<ol>
<li><kbd><span>New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name "packtpub.com" -RecordType "AAAA" -ZoneName "packtpub.com" `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>ResourceGroupName<span> "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 600 `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>DnsRecords<span> (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "&lt;your web app IP address&gt;")</span></kbd><br/>
<br/>
<kbd><span>New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName packtpub.com -ResourceGroupName PacktAzureResourceGroup `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-Name "applicationscs.azurewebsites.net" -RecordType "</span>CNAME<span>" -Ttl 600 `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>DnsRecords<span> (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Value "packtpub.azurewebsites.net")<br/>
<br/></span></kbd></li>
<li><kbd>New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name "@" -RecordType "A" -ZoneName "packtpub.com" `</kbd><br/>
<kbd>-ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 600 `</kbd><br/>

<br/>
<kbd>New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName packtpub.com -ResourceGroupName PacktAzureResourceGroup `</kbd><br/>
<kbd>-Name "@" -RecordType "txt" -Ttl 600 `</kbd><br/>
<kbd>-DnsRecords (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Value "packtpub.azurewebsites.net")</kbd></li>
<li><kbd><span>New-AzDnsRecordSet -Name "applicationscs.azurewebsites.net" -RecordType "AAAA" -ZoneName "packtpub.com" `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>ResourceGroupName<span> "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 600 `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>DnsRecords<span> (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "&lt;your web app IP address&gt;")</span></kbd><br/>
<br/>
<kbd><span>New-AzDnsRecordSet -ZoneName packtpub.com -ResourceGroupName PacktAzureResourceGroup `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-Name "www.packtpub.com" -RecordType "</span><span>AAAA</span><span>" -Ttl 600 `</span></kbd><br/>
<kbd><span>-</span>DnsRecords<span> (New-AzDnsRecordConfig -Value "packtpub.azurewebsites.net")</span></kbd></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Your company plans to release a new web application and it needs to be available for all users on the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> domain. You decide to configure a DNS zone in Azure and check whether the domain is still available. What is the first step that you have to take to configure Azure DNS for this web application?
<ol>
<li>Create a Start of Authority record in your Azure DNS zone that points to Azure DNS servers</li>
<li>Configure a forward DNS zone in Azure</li>
<li>Configure a private DNS zone in Azure</li>
<li>Purchase the <kbd>packtpub.com</kbd> domain from a third-party domain registrar</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You design a virtual network topology with the following characteristics: web subnet: 3 web frontend VMs, app subnet: 3 application server VMs, data subnet: 3 database server VMs. Your company requires that inter-subnet network traffic be strictly controlled with <strong>Network Security Groups</strong> (<strong>NSGs</strong>). You need to design a solution that minimizes NSG rule creation and maintenance. What should you do?
<ol>
<li>Enable the built-in rules in each NSG</li>
<li>Bind a route table to each subnet</li>
<li>Define application security groups that align to each application tier</li>
<li>Enable the Virtual Network NSG Service Tag in each NSG</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<ol>
<li><span>You have deployed an Azure Load Balancer, which is using the Basic tier and is load balancing a set of VMs in an availability set that is called <kbd>PacktSet1</kbd>. You now need to load balance a set of VMs that are deployed to an availability set called <kbd>PacktSet2</kbd>. What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Replace the existing Load Balancer with a new one that is created in the Standard tier and use this Load Balancer for both of the availability sets</li>
<li>Edit the existing Load Balancer and add an additional backend pool to it</li>
<li>Edit the existing Load Balancer and add a new frontend IP configuration to it that will load balance the traffic to the new <span>availability set</span></li>
<li>Deploy a second Load Balancer using the Basic tier and configure this one to load balance the traffic to the new <span>availability set</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span>You deploy an Azure public Load Balancer to load balance traffic to six virtual machines. You want to remotely access VM1 from the internet through the public Load Balancer using the <strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>). What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Set a frontend IP configuration that maps the public IP address to the private IP address of VM1</li>
<li>Configure an inbound network address translation rule that maps the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong>TCP</strong>) port<span> </span><kbd>3389</kbd><span> </span>to VM1</li>
<li>Configure a new internal Load Balancer and configure it to allow the TCP port<span> </span><kbd>3386</kbd><span> </span>from the internet to VM1</li>
<li>Configure a load balancing rule that uses the <span>TCP port <kbd>3386</kbd> to forward traffic to VM1</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span>You deploy an Azure internal Load Balancer to load balance traffic to the internal corporate portal. You want to ensure that users only view the most recent copy of the portal. You created a file called <kbd>NewVersion.html</kbd> and want to configure the Load Balancer to direct the traffic only to the VMs that contain these files. What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Create a new health probe that uses HTTP as the protocol and includes the path to the <kbd><span>NewVersion.html</span></kbd><span> </span>file.</li>
<li>Create a new health probe that uses TCP as the protocol and includes the path to the <span><kbd>NewVersion.html</kbd></span><span> </span>file.</li>
<li>Create a new load balancing rule that includes the path to the <span><kbd>NewVersion.html</kbd></span><span> </span>file. T<span>his rule will only load balance traffic if the file exists.</span></li>
<li>Use the <kbd>Set-AzureRmLoadBalancerProbeConfig</kbd><span> </span>PowerShell cmdlet to create a new h<span>ealth probe that uses HTTP as the protocol and includes the path to the </span><span><kbd>NewVersion.html</kbd></span><span> </span>file.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<ol>
<li><span>You are asked to create a new set of Azure <strong>Active Directory (AD)</strong> security groups that represent the entire hierarchy of a manager's team. This includes people that are managed by the manager. You need to implement the request using the least amount of administrative effort. What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Create new groups using the Direct Reports rule</li>
<li>Create new Azure AD groups for each manager and use a custom script to detect the <kbd>ManagerID</kbd> attribute changes and modify the group membership when needed</li>
<li>Create dynamic groups and Azure AD using a ruleset, including the <kbd>ManagerID </kbd>attribute</li>
<li>Create multiple Azure AD groups and add the members with the same <span><kbd>ManagerID</kbd> attribute value to each group</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You need to grant access to an external consultant to some resources inside your Azure subscription. You plan to add this external user using PowerShell. Which cmdlet should you use?
<ol>
<li><kbd>New-AzADUser</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>New-AzureADMSInvitation</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Get<span>-AzADUser</span></kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Get-AzureADMSInvitation</kbd></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You need to add another administrator who will be responsible for managing all <strong>Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>) deployments in your Azure subscription. You create a new account in Azure AD for the user. You need to configure the user account to meet the following requirements: read and write access to all Azure IaaS deployments, read-only access to Azure AD, and no access to Azure subscription metadata. The solution must also minimize your access maintenance in the future. What should you do?
<ol>
<li>Assign the owner role at the resource level to the user account</li>
<li>Assign the global administrator directory role to the user account</li>
<li>Assign the virtual machine operator role at the subscription level to the user account</li>
<li>Assign the contributor role at the resource group level to<span> the user account</span></li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol>
<li><span>You are asked to configure a solution that allows users to log into Office 365 applications without providing their passwords. Your company also wants to deploy cloud-based two-factor authentication for some user profiles. What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Enable password hash synchronization</li>
<li>Enable pass-through authentication</li>
<li>Install Azure AD Connect</li>
<li>Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You use Azure AD Connect to synchronize all AD domain users and groups with Azure AD. As a result, all users can use <strong>Single Sign-on</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>) to access applications. You should reconfigure the directory synchronization to exclude domain services accounts and user accounts that shouldn't have access to the application. What should you do?
<ol>
<li>Re-run Azure AD Connect</li>
<li>Stop the synchronization service</li>
<li>Remove the domain services and user accounts manually</li>
<li>Configure conditional access rules in Azure AD</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Your company wants to enable all user accounts to use SSO to log in to applications and Office 365. The company has an on-premises AD and uses smartcard authentication. Which solution do you need to deploy to allow users to login without providing a password?
<ol>
<li>Azure AD Connect with pass-through authentication and SSO</li>
<li>Azure AD Connect with pass hash synchronization and SSO</li>
<li><span>Azure AD Connect with pass hash synchronization</span></li>
<li>Active Directory Federation Services</li>

<ol>
<li><span>You deploy <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>)<strong> </strong>in your Azure AD tenant. You don't want your users to be required to enter any additional passwords or code in the browser when using MFA. Which two methods should you make available?</span>
<ol>
<li>Call to phone</li>
<li>Text message to phone</li>
<li>Notification through the mobile app</li>
<li>Verification code from hardware token</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Your company has an <span>Azure AD tenant and an on-premises AD that are synced using Azure AD Connect. Your on-premises environment is running a mix of Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2016 servers. You use Azure MFA for multi-factor authentication. Users report that they are required to use MFA while using company devices. You need to turn MFA off for domain-joined devices. What should you do?</span>
<ol>
<li>Enable SSO on Azure AD Connect</li>
<li>Create a conditional access rule to allow users to use either MFA or a domain-joined device when accessing applications</li>
<li>Configure Windows Hello for Business on all <span>domain-joined devices</span></li>
<li>Add the company external IP address to the Azure MFA Trusted IPs list</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span>Your company has an </span><span>Azure AD tenant and an on-premises AD that are synced using Azure AD Connect. The security department notices a high number of logins from various public IP addresses. What should you do to reduce these logins?</span>
<ol>
<li>Enable Azure AD smart lockout</li>
<li>Add all the public IP addresses to conditional access and use location blocking to deny all login attempts</li>
<li>Create a c<span>onditional access rule to require MFA for all risky logins labeled medium risk and above</span></li>
<li>Turn on Azure MFA fraud alerts</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
