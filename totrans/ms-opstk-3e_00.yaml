    which will provide you with the latest updates and the state of the art in deploying
    and running private cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack. The adoption of OpenStack
    has often been challenging for organizations due to the complexity of its ecosystem
    and fast development across different releases. This book will address those challenges
    by taking an iterative approach for each core component and preparing for a production-ready
    private cloud design. In each chapter, the book draws inspiration from the most
    commonly applied best practices for deploying and managing the infrastructure.
    This includes leveraging infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and DevSecOps paradigms.
    As the book will cover new OpenStack services and advanced concepts, automation
    will be your *guardian angel* to successfully deploy them. This book is also suitable
    for new OpenStack users as it will iterate through its core components and deploying
    them using containers. Extensive knowledge of the containerization technology
    is not required but a basic background is recommended. Most importantly, the book
    focuses on production quality and the most popular deployments inspired by a wide
    range of industries. The OpenStack world can present a massive number of options
    for services and deployments. The book is intended to help you understand how
    to architect and design a private cloud out of the box to meet your organization’s
    needs. Toward the end of this edition, the book will open the curtains on a recent
    trend in the cloud market: the hybrid cloud. OpenStack takes the role of the private
    cloud and joins with an AWS environment to build a hybrid cloud setup. At the
    end of the book, more opportunities will be explored for running large-scale environments
    across different cloud providers where OpenStack fits well as a private cloud
    solution.'

- en: This book is for cloud architects and administrators who have a basic understanding
    of the OpenStack ecosystem as well as the cloud and virtualization concepts. The
    book is useful for enterprise consultants and cloud developers who have working
    experience in the public cloud. Familiarity with Linux command lines and basic
    knowledge of containerization and network topologies are recommended to successfully
    enjoy most of the content of the book.

    Considerations* , summarizes the latest features of the main architectural services
    of OpenStack. The chapter introduces the latest updates of each core component
    of Antelope and later releases. Initial logical and physical design models will
    be drafted and used as an architecture reference for later chapters.'

    Setup – The Right Way (DevSecOps)* , starts by covering the concept of DevOps
    concept with the merge of security aspect. The chapter explores how DevSecOps
    helps to manage, deploy, and automate a large OpenStack private cloud infrastructure
    in the most agile and secure ways. The chapter introduces the Kolla Ansible project,
    which will be used to deploy different OpenStack cloud infrastructure pieces based
    on containers.'

    in cloud controller nodes. The chapter dives into the latest OpenStack updates
    introduced into its control plane, including core service APIs, messaging, and
    database services. Based on the deployment based on containers, the chapter explores
    in more depth different pieces of the Kolla Ansible repository, targeting the
    OpenStack control plane.'

    Scheduling and the Placement service will be covered, including advanced ways
    to carry out resource allocation to run instances in compute nodes. The chapter
    explores the latest updates to compute design for large-scale OpenStack deployments
    by covering the concepts of availability zones, host aggregation, and cells. A
    good part of the chapter is dedicated to learning about incubated projects targeting
    containerization technology in OpenStack. Zun and Magnum will be highlighted and
    deployed the same way as other services using infrastructure as code.'

    including Antelope and subsequent releases. This will highlight any new additions
    and required changes to prepare for the deployment of a private cloud setup. This
    part will review all the required core components to design a robust layout and
    implement it with the most stable operational capabilities, which will include
    all the required services with different configuration options for both the control
    and data plane. This first part of the book is an essential stage for the next
    parts, as it will tackle the ways of deploying different OpenStack services through
    Infrastructure as Code and DevSecOps styles.
