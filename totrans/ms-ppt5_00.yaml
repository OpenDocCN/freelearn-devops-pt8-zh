    – I believe – the premier tool, especially for such larger infrastructures (10,000+
    servers). It is worth mentioning that Ansible has also become very popular, possibly
    due to its shallower learning curve and adoption by Red Hat.

    the latest incarnation of Hiera, which allows us to keep all site-specific and
    business-specific data out of our manifests, making our Puppet modules vastly more
    portable. We also take a quick look in this chapter at the three layers of configuration

    repositories and providing version control and rollback capabilities. We discuss
