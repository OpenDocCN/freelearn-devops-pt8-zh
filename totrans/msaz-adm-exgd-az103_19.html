<p>In the previous chapter, we covered how to configure an internal and external load balancer using Azure Load Balancer. The main focus was on the features and capabilities of Azure Load Balancer, and also on how to create health probes and configure load balancing rules.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces the final objective of this book: the <em>Managing Identities</em><span> </span>objective<em>.</em><span> </span>In this chapter, we are going to cover how to create and manage users and groups in <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> (<strong>Azure AD</strong>). You will learn how to manage this from the Azure portal and how to perform bulk updates inside your Azure AD tenant. You will learn how to configure self-service password reset for your users to reduce user management overhead. We are also going to cover Azure AD Join and how you can manage your devices that are registered or joined in Azure AD. To finish this chapter, we will add a custom domain to Azure AD.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure AD</li>
<li>Creating and managing users and groups</li>
<li>Adding and managing guest accounts</li>
<li>Performing bulk user updates</li>
<li>Configuring self-service password reset</li>
<li>Azure AD Join</li>
<li>Managing device settings</li>
<li>Adding custom domains</li>

<p>Azure AD offers a directory and identity management solution from the cloud. It offers traditional username and password identity management, and roles and permissions management. On top of that, it offers more enterprise-grade solutions, such as <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>) and application monitoring, solution monitoring, and alerting. Azure AD can easily be integrated with your on-premises Active Directory to create a hybrid infrastructure.</p>
<p>Azure AD offers the following pricing plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong>: This offers the most basic features, such as support for up to 500,000 objects, <strong>single sign-on</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>), Azure B2B for external users, support for Azure AD Connect synchronization, <span>self-service password change, groups, </span>and standard security reports.</li>
<li><strong>Basic</strong>: This offers no object limit, a SLA of 99.9%, self-service password reset, company branding features, and support for the Application Proxy.</li>
<li><strong>Premium P1</strong>: This offers advanced reporting, MFA, conditional access, MDM auto-enrollment, cloud app discovery, and Azure AD Connect Health.</li>
<li><strong>Premium P2</strong>: This offers identity protection and Privileged Identity Management.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip">For a detailed overview of the different pricing plans and all the features that are offered for each plan, you can refer to the following pricing page: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Azure AD Premium is part of the Enterprise Mobility and Security Suite.</div>

<p>In this demonstration, we are going to <span>create and manage users and groups in the Azure portal. You can also use PowerShell and CLI to create users. </span></p>
</div>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">We are not going to create an Azure AD tenant in this demonstration. I assume that you already have one. If you need to create an Azure AD tenant, you can refer to the following tutorial: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant</a>. <br/>
<br/>
You can also create multiple Azure AD tenants in one subscription. These directories can <span>be used for development and test</span> <span>purposes, for instance. </span></div>

<p>We will begin by creating a couple of users in our <span>Azure AD tenant from the Azure portal. Therefore, you have to take the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by opening </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the left menu, select<span> <strong><span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span></strong>.</span></li>

<p class="mce-root">You can also add guest accounts in Azure AD using Azure AD <strong>business-to-business</strong> (<strong>B2B</strong>). Azure AD B2B is a feature on top of Azure AD that allows organizations to work safely with external users.

All sorts of accounts can be added to Azure B2B.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You don't have to configure anything in the Azure portal to use B2B; this feature is enabled by default for all Azure AD tenants. Perform the following steps:</p>

<p>With Azure AD Join, you are able to join devices directly to Azure AD without the need to join your on-premises Active Directory in a hybrid environment. While hybrid Azure AD Join with an on-premises AD may still be preferred for some <span>scenarios, Azure AD Join simplifies adding devices and modernizes device management for your organization. This can result in the reduction of device-related IT costs. Your users are getting access to the corporate assets through their devices. To protect these corporate assets, you want to control these devices. This allows your administrators to make sure that your users are accessing resources from devices that meet your standards for security and compliance.</span></p>
<p>Azure AD Join is a good solution when you <span>want to manage devices with a cloud device management solution,</span> <span>modernize your application infrastructure, simplify device provisioning for geographically distributed users, and when your company is adopting Microsoft 365 as the productivity suite for your users.</span></p>

<p>Azure AD offers the ability to ensure that users are accessing Azure resources from devices that meet corporate security and compliance standards. Device management is the foundation for device-based conditional access, where you can ensure that access to your resources in your environment is only possible from managed devices.</p>
<p>Device settings can be <span>managed from the Azure portal. To manage your device settings, your device needs to be registered or joined to Azure AD. </span></p>
<p>To manage the device settings from the Azure portal, you have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by opening </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the left menu, select<span> <strong><span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span></strong></span>.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>To configure device settings, select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Device settings</span></strong> from the left menu. In here, you can configure the following settings, which are shown in the following screenshot:
<ul>
<li><strong>Users may join devices to Azure AD</strong>:<span> Here, you can set which users can join their devices to Azure AD. </span><span>This setting is only applicable to Azure AD Join on Windows 10.</span></li>
<li><strong>Additional local administrators on Azure AD joined devices</strong>: <span>Here, you can select the users that are granted local administrator permissions on a device. The users that are selected here are automatically added to the</span> device administrator's<span> </span><span><span>role in Azure AD. Global administrators in Azure AD and device owners are granted local administrator rights by default (this is an Azure AD Premium option).</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Users may register their devices with Azure AD</strong>: This setting needs to be configured to allow devices to be registered with Azure AD. There are two options here: <strong>None</strong>, that is, devices are not allowed to register <span>when they are not Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined, </span>and <strong>All</strong>, that is, all devices are allowed to register. <span>Enrolment with Microsoft Intune or <strong>Mobile Device Management</strong> (<strong>MDM</strong>) for Office 365 requires registration.

<p>Azure creates an initial domain for every Azure AD tenant that is created in a subscription. This domain name consists of the tenant name, followed by <kbd>onmicrosoft.com</kbd> (<kbd>packtpub.onmicrosoft.com</kbd>). <span>You cannot change or delete the initial domain name, but you can add custom domains to your Azure AD tenant. </span></p>
<p>This custom domain name can be registered at a third-party <span>domain registrar and, after registration, you can add it to the Azure AD tenant. </span></p>
<p>To add a custom domain to Azure AD from the Azure portal, you have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the Azure portal by opening </span><a href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
<li>In the left menu, select<span> <strong><span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span></strong>.</span></li>
<li>In the Azure AD overview blade, under <strong><span class="packt_screen">Manage</span></strong><span>, select </span><strong><span class="packt_screen">Custom domain names</span></strong>. <span>To add a custom domain, select the </span><strong><span class="packt_screen">+ Add custom domain</span></strong> <span>button in the top menu, as follows:</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Adding a custom domain</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Type the custom domain name in the <span class="packt_screen">Custom domain name</span> field (<span>for example, </span><kbd>packtpub.com</kbd>) and select <strong><span class="packt_screen">Add domain</span></strong>, as follows:</li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Providing a custom domain name</div>
<ol start="5">
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">After you add your custom domain name to Azure AD, you need to create a <span class="packt_screen">TXT</span> record inside the DNS settings of your domain <span>registrar</span>. <span>G</span>o to your domain registrar and add the Azure AD DNS information from your copied TXT file. Creating this TXT record for your domain <em>verifies</em> ownership of your domain name. After creating the TXT file, click <strong>Verify</strong>, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7cb86c2f-c381-44fd-81e7-817d70b1deb6.png" style="width:33.75em;height:32.08em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Verifying the ownership of the domain</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>After you've verified y<span>our custom domain name, you can delete your verification TXT or MX file.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We have now configured a custom domain for our Azure AD tenant. Your users can now use this domain name to log in to the various Azure resources they have access to.</p>
