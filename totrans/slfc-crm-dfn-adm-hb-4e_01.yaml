    is delivered across a public network, such as the Internet. [Salesforce.com](http://Salesforce.com)
    has developed various mechanisms to secure the platform and reduce the chances
    of unauthorized people accessing your company data. This chapter describes the
    way login attempts to the system are controlled and the features available to
    help you manage your user's access to the Salesforce CRM application.

    Salesforce and how core information, such as the details that are provided when
    your company first signs up with [Salesforce.com](http://Salesforce.com), can
    be managed. You will also be shown how to find your way around the Salesforce
    Setup menu, and will be introduced to the settings available for the organization-wide
    customization of the application's user interface along with the search facilities
    offered by the Salesforce CRM application.

    and filled with test records. When testing is complete and the test data is no
    longer required, you can truncate the object to remove the test records, but keep
    the object ready to be deployed into production. This is much quicker than batch-deleting
    records and having to recreate the custom object.

- en: Enabling custom fiscal years is not reversible and you cannot revert to standard
    fiscal years. You can, however, set custom fiscal years to mirror the standard
    fiscal year. Because fiscal quarter is based on weekly periods and not months,
    Standard Fiscal Years cannot accommodate reporting, which is why Custom Fiscal
    Years are required.
