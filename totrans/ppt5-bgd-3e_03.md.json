["```\nSummarize changes in around 50 characters or less\n\nMore detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72\ncharacters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as\nthe subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body.\nThe blank line separating the summary from the body is critical\n(unless you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`,\n`shortlog`, and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.\n\nExplain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you\nare making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).\nAre there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this\nchange? Here's the place to explain them.\n\nFurther paragraphs come after blank lines.\n\n - Bullet points are okay, too\n\n - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded\n   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions\n   vary here\n\nIf you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,\nlike this:\n\nResolves: #123\nSee also: #456, #789\n```", "```\n    cd\n    mkdir puppet\n\n    ```", "```\n    cd puppet\n    git init\n    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ubuntu/puppet/.git/\n    ```", "```\n    git config --global user.name \"John Arundel\"\n    git config --global user.email john@bitfieldconsulting.com\n\n    ```", "```\n    echo \"Watch this space... coming soon!\" >README.md\n\n    ```", "```\n    git status\n    On branch master\n    Initial commit\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            README.md\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n    ```", "```\n    git add README.md\n\n    ```", "```\n    git status\n    On branch master\n    Initial commit\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   README.md\n    ```", "```\n    git commit -m 'Add README file'\n    [master (root-commit) ee21595] Add README file\n     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n     create mode 100644 README.md\n    ```", "```\n    git log\n    commit ee215951199158ef28dd78197d8fa9ff078b3579\n    Author: John Arundel <john@bitfieldconsulting.com>\n    Date:   Tue Aug 30 05:59:42 2016 -0700\n        Add README file\n    ```", "```\nMake nginx restart more reliable (fixes issue #75)\n```", "```\n    git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL\n    git push -u origin master\n\n    ```", "```\n    Username for 'https://github.com': pbgtest\n    Password for 'https://pbgtest@github.com':\n    Counting objects: 3, done.\n    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 262 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\n    Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\n    To https://github.com/pbgtest/puppet.git\n     * [new branch]      master -> master\n    Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.\n    ```", "```\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments\nsudo mv production production.sample\nsudo git clone YOUR_REPO_URL production\nCloning into 'production'...\nremote: Counting objects: 3, done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n```", "```\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production && git pull\n/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply manifests/\n```", "```\n    cd /home/ubuntu/puppet\n    mkdir manifests files\n\n    ```", "```\n    cp /examples/files/run-puppet.sh files/\n\n    ```", "```\n    cp /ubuntu/examples/run-puppet.pp manifests/\n\n    ```", "```\n    git add manifests files\n    git commit -m 'Add run-puppet script and cron job'\n    git push origin master\n\n    ```", "```\nsudo git pull\nsudo puppet apply manifests/\nNotice: Compiled catalog for localhost in environment production in 0.08 seconds\nNotice: /Stage[main]/Main/File[/usr/local/bin/run-puppet]/ensure: defined content as '{md5}83a6903e69564bcecc8fd1a83b1a7beb'\nNotice: /Stage[main]/Main/Cron[run-puppet]/ensure: created\nNotice: Applied catalog in 0.07 seconds\n```", "```\n# HEADER: This file was autogenerated at 2017-04-05 01:46:03 -0700 by puppet.\n# HEADER: While it can still be managed manually, it is definitely not recommended.\n# HEADER: Note particularly that the comments starting with 'Puppet Name' should\n# HEADER: not be deleted, as doing so could cause duplicate cron jobs.\n# Puppet Name: run-puppet\n*/15 * * * * /usr/local/bin/run-puppet\n```"]
