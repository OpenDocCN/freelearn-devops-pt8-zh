    which is the first credential in Salesforce's Certified Administrator program
    that has been developed by Salesforce for the assessment of individuals who have
    Salesforce CRM administration knowledge and experience. The Certified Administrator
    program covers the applications that form the core elements of Salesforce CRM
    and includes system management and the configuration options that are available
    to a Salesforce CRM administrator within the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, and
    the Collaboration Cloud.

    ability to manage and maintain a Salesforce CRM organization. Individuals that
    pass the exam can be considered proficient in applying the features and functionality
    for configuration and system management as well as extending their knowledge and
    accessing advanced learning paths within the Certified Administrator program.

    individual they felt it was more difficult than their bachelor's degree or their
    MBA.

    in which the multiple-choice questions are worded means that there are one or
    two word differences between the available choice of answer. This then suggests
    that the question may be subjective, which presents a challenge when choosing
    the expected answer.
