    now run on different systems located on-premises, off-premises, in multiple clouds,
    and at the edge. Proper planning, implementation, and management of these diverse
    environments are critical factors in helping your users and your organization
    to make the most of them. This chapter focuses on the role of Azure hybrid and

    resources (such as an on-premises datacenter). This can offer greater flexibility,
    more deployment options, scalability, and operational consistency.

    multiple service providers. This can provide increased flexibility and better
    risk mitigation, as you can choose a combination of services and regional providers

    devices close to the endpoints where data is created and consumed. These endpoints
    could include process control systems on production lines, building surveillance
    systems, and sensors and actuators at remote sites.

    of different factors. For instance, a hybrid cloud approach that includes on-premises
    systems might be the best choice for your organization to meet regulatory and
    data sovereignty requirements while enhancing resilience and business continuity.

    offline availability in the field, edge computing, with its **virtual machines**

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to keep in mind that hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge computing
    may also add operational complexity. For example, multicloud necessitates dealing
    with different cloud environments across different service providers, which poses
    an additional challenge for any organization already facing a shortage of cloud
    talent. In this case, a solution like Azure can help because it is designed to
    facilitate the management of multicloud as well as hybrid cloud and edge computing.

- en: The advantages of containers, including their portability, efficiency, and scalability,
    have made them popular for deploying business applications. New applications can
    be created as microservices in Kubernetes clusters. Legacy applications can be
    modernized by rewriting them as containers. However, with these possibilities
    comes the need for management of Kubernetes at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure Arc addresses this need, letting organizations deploy applications quickly
    to any Kubernetes cluster across multiple locations under robust management policies.
    This capability is enabled through **Azure Kubernetes Configuration Management**
    (**AKCM**), an Azure service that delivers configuration management and application
    deployment from Azure, using GitOps. Continuous, compliant deployment can be assured
    by linking application policies to specific GitHub repositories. With this capability,
    cluster admins can declare their cluster configuration and applications in Git.
    The development teams can then use pull requests and the tools they are familiar
    with (existing DevOps pipelines, Git, Kubernetes manifests, and Helm charts, for
    example) to easily deploy applications onto Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters
    and make updates in production. The GitOps agents listen to changes and facilitate
    automated rollbacks if these changes result in system divergence from the source
    of truth.

    centralized control of compliance and configuration. The IT team can also monitor,

    and cloud), Azure Stack HCI combined with Azure hybrid services provides capabilities
    such as disaster recovery and backup options for your VMs, as well as cloud-based
    monitoring. You also get a single pane of glass for all your deployments and the
    ability to manage the cluster with tools such as Windows Admin Center, System
    Center, and PowerShell. In addition, AKS on Azure Stack HCI is available. It is
    an on-premises implementation of the AKS orchestratorâ€”see [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview).

    has several potential benefits. It can enhance scalability and facilitate management
    and security for your environment. It can also reduce the footprint and total
    cost of ownership by replacing legacy SAN storage. Unified tools and interfaces,
    together with a single point of support, simplify systems administration and operations.

- en: Management of hybrid infrastructure can be challenging for enterprises with
    branch offices. When multiple locations must function without dedicated IT staff,
    it becomes more complicated to keep identity services synchronized, make data
    backups, and deploy applications. In this situation, businesses often need weeks
    or months to roll out application updates across multiple offices and infrastructures.
    Better solutions are needed to deploy application and identity changes quickly
    and easily across remote offices while enabling centralized monitoring for anomalies
    and violations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider the example of an international bank with 300 offices worldwide, for
    which each global update of all offices requires a year. To compound the problem,
    the multiple locations make it difficult to consistently correct configurations
    and avoid potential security risks such as open ports. New and updated app rollouts
    to branch offices are also a problem for any company that has double- or triple-digit
    numbers of such sites. This is especially true when remote sites need to run apps
    on local servers for reasons of latency or restricted internet connectivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help you overcome these challenges, Azure Stack HCI offers HCI based on industry-standard
    x86 servers with software-defined compute, storage, and networking. Using Azure
    Arc integration built into the Windows Admin Center, you can easily begin using
    the Azure portal cloud to manage your HCI. Reducing or removing the need for local
    IT staff, you can meet the evolving IT demands of branch offices, retail stores,
    and field locations, deploying container-based apps anywhere and essential business
    applications in highly available VMs. Azure Monitor then allows you to view system
    health across these different domains.

    including retail stores and field sites (two-server cluster solutions are currently
    available for less than $20,000 per location). Nested resiliency means that volumes
    can remain online and accessible even in the event of multiple simultaneous hardware
    failures. Cloud witness technology enables the use of Azure as the lightweight
    tiebreaker for cluster quorum. This prevents split-brain conditions yet does not
    involve the cost of a third host. In the Azure portal, you are given a centralized
    view of remote Azure Stack HCI deployments.

    It brings Azure services into your datacenter. On the other hand, with Azure Stack
    HCI, you can use existing skills and familiar processes, and you connect your
    datacenter to Azure services. It may also be useful to compare what Azure Stack
    Hub and Azure Stack HCI are not designed to do, or possible constraints.

- en: As business environments evolve, software applications may run on different
    systems on-premises, off-premises, in multiple clouds, and at the edge of networks.
    Hybrid and multicloud solutions can enable you to successfully deploy and manage
    your apps if you also create a single, consistent environment across the locations
    of your organization. In doing so, you offer your developers a unified set of
    tools for building apps. You can easily move apps and data between locations to
    ensure efficiency and compliance, and to offer your users an optimal experience.

    and multicloud solutions and products. Azure Arc offers unified management to
    deploy Azure services and extend Azure management anywhere. With Azure Arc enabled
    servers, you can apply native Azure VM management to Windows and Linux machines
    outside Azure. With Azure Arc and Kubernetes, you can run specified Azure data
    services on the infrastructure of your choice.

    locations, letting you create and run hybrid applications for diverse workloads
    consistently across locations and environments. Azure Stack Hub is a cloud-native
    integrated system that lets you use Azure cloud services on-premises, while Azure
    Stack HCI offers HCI that modernizes datacenters and virtualization hosts.
