  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a practical introduction to creating applications using containers.
    Readers will learn what containers are and why they are a new application deployment
    standard. We will start the journey with key concepts about containers, their
    features and usage, and how they will help us secure and speed up an application’s
    life cycle. You will also learn how to create secure container images for your
    applications and how to share and run them in different development stages and
    production.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is divided into different parts to help you use the software container
    technology. First, you will learn how to use a host environment to build and run
    your applications using multiple components, and then you will learn how to run
    them when distributed in complex container orchestrators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on the Kubernetes container orchestrator because of its unique
    features and popularity. You will learn how to use different Kubernetes resources
    to securely accomplish different application architecture models. You will also
    find different software options in this book that will help you create and test
    your applications on your desktop, using fully functional Kubernetes-packaged
    platforms. We will teach you how to use these Kubernetes desktop environments
    to prepare your applications, using the best security practices to deliver them
    on any Kubernetes platform. We will cover important topics such as data management
    (configurations, sensitive data, and application data), different mechanisms to
    publish applications, and application observability (monitoring, logging, and
    traceability).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we will show you how to automate the building, testing, and delivery
    of your applications, creating continuous integration and continuous delivery
    workflows that run within Kubernetes clusters.
