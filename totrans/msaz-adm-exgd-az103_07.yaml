    objective*.* In the first part of this chapter, we are going to create storage
    accounts, by configuring Azure Blob Storage. The second part of this chapter is
    going to cover how you can import and export data to and from Azure. You will
    learn how to import and export data using Azure Job. The third part of this chapter
    is focused on **content delivery networks **(**CDNs**) in Azure. You will learn
    how to create and configure a CDN, which can be used for caching your static content
    on the edge servers in Azure. In the last part of this chapter, we will briefly
    look at Azure Data Box.

    needs to be prepared using the `WAImportExport.exe` tool. By running this tool,
    there is automatically a *journal file* created in the same folder that you ran
    the tool. There are two other files created as well, an `.xml` file and a `drive-manifest.xml` file.

    static content, such as HTML pages, style sheets, images, documents, files, and
    client-side scripts on edge servers in different regions. This way, it will take
    less time to download them because the content is physically closer to the user,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    closer to the end users to speed up the performance of loading the files. However,
    with dynamic web applications, the content is generated in response to the user
    behavior. Speeding up the loading process is more complex in these situations
    and requires a different solution, where each content element is fine-tuned along
    the full data path from inception to delivery. This feature is part of *Azure

    HTTPS on a CDN endpoint host name by default. So, if you create a CDN endpoint
