- en: At AWS re:Invent 2017, a new launch type for containers called Fargate was announced.
    This book is about Amazon Fargate, the new launch type for the Amazon **Elastic
    Container Service** (**ECS**) for Docker containers.

- en: Docker is the de factostandard containerization framework that has revolutionized
    packaging and deployment of software. Amazon Fargate has made the ECS platform
    serverless; no EC2 instances to provision, run, or manage. Amazon Fargate runs
    ECS services on Docker containers and exposes the service tasks directly to the
    user. Fargate has much simplified the ECS platform by making it serverless.

- en: '[Chapter 1](c1c9718a-58b6-41b1-a9f3-0c3e5cb9d5c4.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    Amazon ECS and Amazon Fargate*, is an introductory chapter in which we discuss
    the benefits of using the Fargate launch type, how compute resources are distributed
    and configured with Fargate launch type, the ECS objects in Fargate that are the
    same as for the EC2 launch type, and the new features in Fargate.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](20fbdcad-0dd7-4066-aafb-1bc74b268b33.xhtml), *Networking*, introduces
    the Fargate launch type as used with an ECS cluster. We will create a cluster,
    including container, task, and service definitions, using a Hello World Docker
    image. Subsequently, we will invoke the Hello World application using the IPv4
    Public IP of the Elastic Network Interface associated with a task.'

    Logs*, discusses configuring an ECS container for logging. We demonstrated CloudWatch
    Logs using an ECS service for MySQL database. The only supported log driver for
    the Fargate launch type is the awslogs driver.'

    ECS service auto scaling as used with the Fargate launch type. Configuring auto
    scaling involves setting a range (minimum and maximum) for a number of tasks,
    within which auto scaling is applied.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](bb848e54-5b98-4ec4-91b8-7869dde890cf.xhtml), *Using IAM*, discusses
    configuring an IAM user for ECS. The root user does not require any permissions
    configuration and has access to the ECS resources, ECS Console, ECS API, and all
    the required AWS services. If an IAM user is to be used with ECS, the required
    IAM policies must be added to the IAM user.'

    with an application load balancer to balance the HTTP requests for a Hello World
    service.'

    Then, we will deploy a Docker Compose file on the cluster to run a task for a
    WordPress Docker image.'
